Scoping out oscilloscopes again.

The dollar is currently at AR$140.

A [Hantek 6022be][0] USB scope goes for AR$13900 (US$99): 20 MHz, 8
bits, 48Msps, two channels, new, two probes, up to 5V, or 50V with the
probes set to 10×.  [It’s fully supported in sigrok][1] and loads its
firmware over USB.  That’s a seller in Chacarita, and several other
sellers have similar prices.

Several sellers sell the toy [single-channel DSO138 200kHz][2] for
less, like AR$8000 (US$50).

Used analog oscilloscopes are the other option; a [20MHz 2-channel
Hitachi V-212][3] in Rosario for AR$20k (but no shipping), a [20MHz
2-channel Protomax ??? missing its probes][4] in Buenos Aires for
AR$13800, a [20MHz 2-channel Pintek PS-200][5] in Haedo for AR$28000,
a [20MHz 2-channel Beckman 9102][6] in Martínez for AR$50k, a [20MHz
single-channel GW GOS-3310][7] missing its probes and maybe not
working in Tres Lomas for AR$9000, an [8MHz single-channel
Monfrini][8] missing its probes and maybe not working in Lomas de
Zamora for AR$8900, a [20MHz 2-channel Pintek PS-200][9] for AR$14500
in Santa Rosa, San Luis, and so on.

None of the analog oscilloscopes are all three of ① complete and
working, ② possessed of two channels, and ③ cheaper than the Hantek
scope by more than a trivial amount.  Most of them are simultaneously
more expensive and less capable.  And there don’t seem to be any
USB scopes that are significantly cheaper.

But I don’t know if it’s really worth spending US$100 on.  Maybe I
should wait to see if something cheaper comes along.
