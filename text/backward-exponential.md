Suppose we want 16 earth-surfaces’ worth of human living space by the
year 02050, in orbit around the sun, using an exponentially growing
colony of 3-D printers that starts growing in 02029.

How much material is this?  The classic approach is rotating space
stations in order to provide artificial gravity of one gee.  Suppose
we don’t have a stronger material for this than music wire, whose free
breaking length is 35 km (2700 MPa / (7.9 g/cc) / gravity).  (We can
hope that carborundum fiber (110 km), basalt fiber (183 km),
monocrystalline iron whiskers (183 km), UHMWPE (378 km), carbon fiber
(399 km), nanotube rope (4700 km), etc., are options, but maybe they
won’t work out.)  We can't use *all* the structure’s weight in tensile
supports against its own centrifugal force, since we also want lakes
and soil and stuff; suppose we use an “overhead factor” of 3.

(Ugh, I’m tangling up in mental knots trying to figure this out.)

So, uh, suppose our habitat soil and lakes etc. is about 10 meters
deep, so we need about 20 tonnes of soil per square meter, plus
another similar amount of our bargain-basement Victorian-era scrith,
let’s say 64 tonnes per square meter in total.  149 million km², the
Earth’s land surface, is then 9.5 × 10¹⁸ kg (9.5 zettagrams).  16
times that is 153 zettagrams, round it up to 200 zettagrams (2 × 10²⁰
kg), about 0.3% of the mass of the Moon, all of the mass of asteroid
Pallas, or 7% of the mass of the main asteroid belt.

If the initial 3-D printer weighs 100 g in 02029, that’s a factor of 2
× 10²¹ growth in 21 years, which is fairly slow by the standards of
bacteria and fungi, about 0.64% per day, doubling every 108 days.  A
human growing from 4 kg to 40 kg in 10 years is on average much
slower, of course, but during their first 3 months after birth they
grow perhaps from 3.5 kg to 6.5 kg, nearly the same speed.

At this speed, we have the following growth curve:

As Machiavelli points out, any innovation is likely to provoke
opposition from entrenched interests.  Experience in 02020 has shown
that existing human institutions are not equipped to stop or respond
to exponential phenomena with doubling times of around a week, so this
is probably a better benchmark to shoot for, although of course in
this case the phenomenon is a liberatory phenomenon of human
empowerment rather than an epidemic of a virus.

Having the seed on Earth is not equivalent to having it in orbit
around the Sun; launching things into orbit is expensive and tightly
surveilled.  There are two likely ways to cross this bridge.

The first is to get a single spore off Earth as early as possible and
grow it among the asteroids, which has the disadvantage that it
requires access to space launch very early on, before a significant
quantity of printers have been built.  Worse, it’s not just space
launch but actually escape velocity, which means launching not just a
printer but a thruster that can provide the other half of the Δv.
this would benefit from having as small a printer as possible,
especially absent buy-in from the entrenched interests mentioned
above; the Space Surveillance Network publicly catalogs 17480 objects
mostly 10cm (1ℓ) or larger, so we’d have to assume objects down to 3cm
are usually detectable even today, especially if they’re in LEO doing
things like emitting plumes of plasma.  So the target design size
would probably have to be about 10g or less: the future of a galaxy
contained in the mass of a coin.

The other possibility is to grow the 3-D printer ecosystem here on
Earth until it can print abundant space launch resources, perhaps in
02040 or thereabouts.  This avoids the risk of provoking opposition at
an earlier, more fragile stage of the project, but it means that
inevitably it will have to face opposition *before* making the leap
off Earth, and consequently is at serious risk of being strangled in
the cradle.  It also limits the material and energy resources that
will be available to the project during that time to what is available
on Earth.  However, everything done on Earth is enormously easier in
some ways — to fix when it breaks, especially — and there are many
resources on Earth that are hard to find elsewhere, such as
microprocessors.
