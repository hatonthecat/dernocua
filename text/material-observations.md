Some notes on some things I tried.

-----------

Pouring sodium silicate solution into concentrated oil of lime hardens
the surface enough that it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the yogurt
cup, and you can pick up the resulting ooze by hand.  Placing the ooze
on a bed of vermiculite and pouring hot construction sand (300°?) over
it produces foamed glass, which grows over a longer period of time
than the foamed glass produced from dried waterglass, but with about
the same density.  However, it sticks to the sand and vermiculite as
it grows.

Having burned through a cotton towel when pouring hot sand previously,
I used a steel wool pad as a hotpad in this case, which worked fine.
Obviously there are drawbacks to using such inflammable materials as
insulating refractory, but in this case it didn’t ignite, and it
worked fine to protect my fingers.

Having melted the aluminum parts of the previous butane-torch nozzle
(the kind that uses 227-gram cans of butane), I bought a somewhat more
robust one from the hardware store for US$6, with no evident aluminum
or plastic parts and no striker.  This can produce a substantially
more exciting flame.

### Borax ###

Bought some 700 g borax from the hardware store for some US$2.  Smells
slightly acidic, suggesting it’s maybe contaminated with boric acid.
It successfully cross-links PVA glue (“plasticola”) into an insoluble
mass.  A hot wire causes it to adhere readily; application of heat
causes it to foam up quite a bit, suggesting that it’s quite hydrated,
and then collapse down into a glassy layer of, presumably, mostly
boria, which seems to be able to mostly dissolve construction sand
when reheated.  This suggests that it really is borax.

Heating the borax on low heat on the stove on some aluminum foil
produces a prodigious amount of white solid foam, similar to the
intumescent foam from sodium silicate (see file `glass-foam.md`),
which can be cut with a hot wire.  A drop of water on this foam has no
immediately obvious effect, but after a few minutes, has dissolved a
hole some 30 mm in diameter.

### Quartz-halogen bulbs ###

The internal bulb in one of these halogen household bulbs can be
heated to an orange heat in the butane torch without any softening,
and even quenching in water does not crack them.  This strongly
suggests that it really is quartz.  Too bad it’s burned out.  These
bulbs are hard to find nowadays, though some vendors have some
remaining stock for under US$1 each, and 150W–500W exterior halogen
floodlights still cost only US$2–US$4.

The replacement headlight bulb I got from an auto parts store (US$3)
has the same behavior, except that I haven’t tried quenching it,
suggesting that it’s also a quartz-halogen bulb.  (Also, the box
carries a pictorial warning against touching the glass.)  This is a
Magneti Marelli “H7 12V 55W PX26d”.  Cold (10°?) it measures some 7Ω
on a shitty multimeter that measures 3Ω short-circuit, demonstrating
why household 240V quartz-halogen bulbs would be better for use as
RTDs.  When reheated to orange-hot, it measures 2Ω but the meter's
short-circuit resistance has dropped to 1Ω, demonstrating that the
meter is totally inadequate for this purpose.  For heating-element
purposes such a bulb ought to be adequate up to nearly 1000°.

### Pumice and garden stores ###

I bought 10 liters of off-white pumice from the garden store for US$2.
It’s so porous that it floats, but it’s open-cell enough that
sometimes it becomes waterlogged and sinks after a few seconds.  It
seems to weigh about 3.5 kg.  Stone dimensions are on the order of
10–40 mm.  It can be heated to orange heat in the blowtorch without
apparent change.  A hacksaw cuts it almost as easily as wood; a steel
wire can bore a hole through it far more easily than through wood, and
without cracking it in half.  It can be easily sanded on granite or on
other pumice stones, yielding a fine floury dust.

Though there is significant variation, it’s too hard to crush between
my fingers, break with my fingers, or carve with thumbnails in its
default form, though you can drill through it with a bamboo chopstick
and enough effort.  However, heating it to orange heat in the
blowtorch renders it somewhat more fragile (presumably by thermal
shock inducing microfractures), so that it can be broken by hand,
though still not crushed between my fingers.  Simply soaking it in
water does not have such a weakening effect, but quenching it in water
after such heating weakens the stone to an even greater degree.

One stone weighs 6.7 g.  When added to 151.3 g of tap water (including
yogurt cup), the reading was 158.1, a reading of 6.8 g.  Later the
reading was 157.9, and upon depressing it below the surface of the
water with wires, 159.1, suggesting 1.2 cc of volume out of the water,
or some 7.9 cc of total volume.  Upon removing the wet stone from the
water, the reading dropped from 158.0 to 150.2, a difference of 7.8 g,
and the wet stone weighed 7.7 g, suggesting there was 1.05 g of water
in its pore volume.  This suggests a total volume, including pore
volume around 9.0 cc and thus a dry density of 0.74 g/cc.

I stopped by a grow shop and was disappointed to find very little in
the way of pure fertilizers and pesticides, less even than in the
local garden store.

### Carbonates and phosphates of iron ###

The garden-store green vitriol looks quite pure, though clumping
together like a gorgeous green deliquescent thing, but the solution in
tap water is a bit cloudy.  Adding an excess of baking soda produces,
after a while, voluminous green-brown bubbles that grow quite large
and do not pop, overflowing my inadequate yogurt cup.  A gray-green
gritty slime with a smell like metal precipitates; this is probably a
mix of carbonates and hydroxides of iron.  Effervescence continues for
an hour or more; probably boiling the soda first would have avoided
it.  Adding diammonium phosphate fertilizer instead in solid form
produces no visible reaction at first, but upon heating produces a
milky white precipitate, which later proceeds to form convection cells
like those in miso soup.

### Iron products ###

Neither of the insoluble iron preparations have defecated to anything
like transparency.  Gravity filtration of the carbonate through a
coffee filter leaves a dark green-brown mud on the filter and a fairly
cloudy filtrate, which defecates.  The mud smells like sulfur or
metal, but the filtrate smells like dust.  A second filtration still
leaves a cloudy filtrate.

The phosphate is instead partly white, partly gray, with some solid
chunks which presumably result from the green vitriol remineralizing
the fertilizer prills without letting them completely dissolve.  It
has a similar metallic/sulfurous smell, and similarly the filtrate
through coffee filters is cloudy.  No ammonia smell is detectable.
Excitingly, some of the phosphate product required a bit of work with
a chopstick to scrape free of the epoxy (?) liner of the aluminum can.
But this may have been because I overheated it when heating the
mixture.  I should maybe recrystallize some of the ammonium phosphate
and figure out some of the stoichiometry.

### Pumice grinding ###

Grinding the surface of the pumice with, for example, bamboo, tends to
make the surface harder and less porous, because it fills the exposed
bubbles with packed powder.  When a hole thus drilled with a bamboo
chopstick has recently broken through, there is greater risk of
breaking the rock by wedging.

### Muriate of lime ###

Put 108.0 g of water in a 10.9 g cut-off can and started heating it up
gently.  Too bad I don’t have a thermometer.  After heating to boiling
it weighed 117.8 g.  Adding (hopefully anhydrous) muriate of lime it
had all dissolved up to a total weight of 235 g,
so the amount of muriate was also 117 g.  At 282.0 g total
weight some of the crystals remained undissolved, but then did
dissolve, with a weight gain to 287.6 g.  I added more crystals to
322.1 g and a little bit seems undissolved; gentle heating dissolved
them, reducing the weight to 321.9 g.  Adding more crystals to get up
to 341.9 g leaves some crystals undissolved.  Further gentle heating
leaves weight at 341.6 and dissolves all crystals; adding more
crystals to 366.0 g leaves some crystals undissolved at first.
Further gentle heating dissolves all crystals and leaves the weight at
364.1 g; adding more crystals brings the weight to 387.5 g.
Further gentle heating dissolves all crystals and leaves the weight at
385.3 g; I added more crystals to 442.2 g.

And then I gave up.  I think those dissolved too.  I’m letting it cool
now; a thin crust of solid has formed at the surface, preventing
further evaporation.

After a couple of hours, the material in the can has the appearance of
a solid, transparent block, but this is an illusion; once the crust is
broken, the inside can be seen to be a mix of rather jagged crystals
of muriate of lime and warm, syrupy oil of lime, which stick nicely to
the finger.

### NightHawkInLight’s intumescent refractory ###

Now I have borax so I should be able to make resistant carbonizing
intumescent refractory materials.  [One person reports success][1]
with 10 tsp cornstarch, 1 tsp baking soda, 4 tsp PVA glue, and no
extra water.  [NightHawkInLight is reported by WP][2] to have switched
from this recipe to cornstarch, flour, sugar, and borax, which was
less prone to mold; in [his video on the improved formulation][3] he
explains (3'47"):

> I’ve also found an optional ingredient that adds both mold and
> insect resistance, as well as an improvement I did *not* expect,
> which I’ll talk about in a moment.  These are the ingredients i used
> in my improved composition: 40 grams of flour, then 20 grams each of
> corn starch, powdered sugar, and baking soda, combining this
> together with approximately 25 grams of water creates a workable
> dough.
> 
> It may seem like a lousy cookie recipe, but each of these
> ingredients serves a specific and important purpose.  The flour is
> my new binder which holds all the rest of the ingredients

> better hold its shape.  And sugar is the secret to generating a
> carbon foam even when the resulting material is bone dry.
> 
> When heat is applied to my composition, the sugar inside will melt,
> providing elasticity and lubrication between the other chemicals so

> vapor as gas when heated, so borax could replace baking soda in my
> formula entirely.

At this point he shows his notebook with something like eight alternative recipes:

- 5 g baking soda, 10 g borax, 10 g sugar, 5 g corn starch, 25 g
  flour, 5 g diatomaceous earth;
- 50 g corn starch, 25 g erythritol, 25 g ammonium diphosphate [sic] +
  shellac as a possible coating;
- 10 g sugar, 20 g flour, 10 g borax, and “mod + 5 g baking soda”.  A
  second column says that using 10 g flour instead of 20, it was “a
  little melty”.
- On an earlier page, .5 g alum, 2 g iron phos[phate], 2.5 g flour; or
- 3 g iron phos[phate], 1 g urea, 3 g alum, 1 g “cs” (cornstarch?), 16 g
  flour, 2 g sugar; marked “almost as good →” with an arrow pointing to:
- “Best”: 10 g corn starch, 20 g flour, 10 g baking soda (or borax, as
  suggested by a video edit), 10 g powdered sugar, 25 g water for 2×
  batch; one Xed out column instead suggests 10 g corn starch, 50 g
  flour, 20 g baking soda, 20 g powdered sugar; a third column
  suggests 5 g corn starch, 25 g flour, 10 g baking soda, and 10 g
  powdered sugar.  And, finally,
- 1 g “Kno3” (!), 2 g iron II phosphate, 10 g corn starch, 20 g flour,
  10 g sugar, 20 g water.

So, I guess I’ll try his recommended recipe: 40 g flour, 20 g corn
starch, 20 g sugar, 20 g borax, and 25 g water.

I mixed:

- 40.2 g 000 white flour (Cañuelas brand)
- 20.4 g borax
- 20.0 g sugar (granulated, Ledesma azúcar común tipo “A”, freely
  flowing and so apparently fairly dry)
- 20.4 g manioc starch (I couldn’t find the cornstarch)
- 37.4 g water (I poured too fast and overshot by 50%)

The total ball of dough was 133.9 g, so I probably lost about 4.5 g
that stuck to the mixing container or my hands or whatever.  It
smelled like cookie dough and had a tendency to kind of slump,
probably due to having too much water.  I was able to use it to cover
the inside of a Monster can with the ends cut off and heat the can
from the inside with the hand butane torch, and it did indeed foam up
and produce an aroma similar to burnt toast and a carbon foam similar
in hardness to insulating firebrick.

After letting the can cool, I turned the flame back on and ran it
through the can again while holding it between my fingers; after about
30 seconds, the can became too hot to hold comfortably.

I heated up a small, thin piece (initially on a bed of waterglass
foam, then inside the Monster-can “forge”) to see if I could cook it
thoroughly into foam to get some kind of read on its material
properties.  During this process I noticed a second objectionable
feature of this composition, aside from the burnt-toast smoke: it has
a tendency to continue to smolder for a while after the source of heat
is removed.  (I wrapped the piece in aluminum foil to put it out
without wetting it.)  Also, significant cracks were opening up in the
lining of the Monster can, although they seem to have been exposing
uncooked dough rather than unprotected aluminum.

After all that, the piece turned out to be under 100 mg and so too
small for my shitty scale to weigh, even when wet.  It floated in
water mostly below the surface, similar to the pumice, but it’s hard
to tell how much of that is a question of water absorption.

In terms of fragility, it is definitely less fragile than the
waterglass foam, and definitely more fragile than pumice.

Heating some more of this stuff with he blowtorch on top of the
waterglass foam, I notice that each little black particle has a little
crater around it in the waterglass foam, like snow around de-icing
salt on a sidewalk.  This suggests that either the carbon particles
are producing heat to melt the waterglass around them, for example by
burning (quite possible), or that the borax in them is fluxing the
waterglass foam and allowing it to soften and collapse at a lower
temperature (also possible).

One of the resulting chunks of carbon foam ranges from 15 mm in
thickness to 25 mm in length and weighs 1.0 g.

Density measurement: I placed a 64.5 g cup of water on the scale.
Immersing the foam in it beneath the surface with chopsticks yielded a
reading of 68.1 g; removing it produced a reading of 61.8 g; weighing
the foam separately yielded 3.7; immersing it a second time produced a
reading of 67.8; weighing it a second time produced a weight of 4.0; a
final weighing of the cup produced a reading of 61.4.  Apparently in
the first immersion it absorbed 2.7 g of water (both the difference in
the foam and in the water), having displaced 3.6 cc of water; after
the second immersion it had absorbed 3.0–3.1 g of water and was
displacing 3.3 cc of water.  So its total volume was 6.3 cc, including
both the pore spaces that filled with water and those that excluded
water, but not including spaces from which the water drained
immediately upon removal.  This is a pretty reasonable volume, given
that 15 mm × 20 mm × 25 mm would have been 7.5 cc, and the shape was
quite irregular.  So the density of the foam as such is about
0.16 g/cc.

The water in this process turned dirty brown and had lots of black
crap floating in it, so presumably there was a significant amount of
lost mass.  On soaking the foam a little longer, the water turned
quite black.

After driving the water off from the foam that hasn’t dissolved with
the torch, it weighed 800 mg, so only about 20% was lost.

I’ve flattened out a remaining piece of the dough to let it air-dry so
that I can test its intumescent properties after drying.

### Waterglass and starch intumescent refractory ###

It occurs to me that a 1:1 molar ratio of carbon sources such as
cornstarch with silicon sources such as waterglass might be able to
produce a foam that is partly or wholly carborundum (melting point
2830°), which would have mechanical and oxidation-resistance
properties superior to carbon foam, and mechanical and melt-resistance
properties superior to silicate glass foams.  Boron carbide B₄C would
probably be superior (harder than carborundum, softer only than CBN
and diamond) but I think it’s probably even harder to produce than
carborundum; Moissan’s original synthesis involved heating boria with
carbon over the melting point of boron carbide, 2763°, though
apparently magnesium permits the reaction under much less violent
conditions.

Mixing a little waterglass with manioc starch produces a mixture with
the consistency of warm chewing gum; I kept adding starch and kneading
it in until it seemed like adding more starch would make it fall
apart.  (But I don’t know whether this is 1:3, 1:1, 3:1, or what.)
The resulting rubbery, doughy substance is intumescent under the
flame, producing a black foam with similar strength to that of the
borax-based recipe above, though perhaps with a smaller cell size,
but, as I was hoping, this foam has no tendency to smolder.  Also,
perhaps unsurprisingly, it stuck rather tightly to the foamed
waterglass bed I was trying to heat it on, which the carbon/borax foam
did not.  I’ve left a fragment of this composition also to dry.  While
intumescing it produced a scent vaguely reminiscent of pine pitch,
which strikes me as slightly alarming.

Both this foam and the waterglass-free version can be very readily cut
with a hacksaw.

### Waterglass, borax, and starch intumescent refractory ###

It occurred to me that maybe borax would be compatible with
waterglass, and indeed you can mix quite a lot of borax and water into
this waterglass solution without coagulating it in the way calcium or
magnesium ions do.  (I was concerned that perhaps the borate ions
would be sufficiently amphiphilic to cross-link the silicate, but
apparently not.)  Mixing up manioc starch as before with this mixture
produces another white doughy mixture which produces intumescent black
foam when heated — though there are also bits of white foam, which may
have been undissolved borax crystals.  I’ve left a couple of these
samples also to dry and see how they behave.  One I heated
immediately; it also has the unnerving pine-resin smell, and the foam
it produces is the hardest yet — I can barely carve it with my
thumbnail.  I ran out of butane for the torch in the process, so I
heated the sample for a longer period of time on the kitchen stove’s
gas flame.  Hacksawing through it reveals that although it has foamed
up throughout its thickness, only the outermost 5 mm charred, leaving
an inner circle of white uncharred material separated from the
fissured outer carbon foam by a brown ring.

As with the waterglass/starch mix, the foam shows no tendency to
smolder.

I can still break this foam material by hand, but it is hard enough
that I cannot crush it between my fingers.  Taking a 12-mm-diameter
bit of it that weighs in at 0.65 g, I tried repeating the earlier
density measurement but screwed up my measurements; I think the water
weighs 81.9 g after pulling the wet foam out, 83.6 with it immersed,
and the wet foam weighs 1.6 g.  Or maybe it’s 80.7 g after the foam is
removed.  So it absorbed 0.95 g of water and displaced 1.7–2.9 g,
which is really a damned wide range, so its volume including pores is
2.65–3.85 cc.  Which is totally impossible, because (12mm)³ =
1.728 cc, so it’s somewhere in the range 0.17–0.72 g/cc.  Not a good
measurement by any stretch of the imagination.  All you can say is
that it floats if it’s dry.  It turns out that it floats if it’s wet,
too, barely, so I guess it’s below 0.4 g/cc dry.

So, I’ll have to redo the test with a larger piece, maybe after I get
more butane.

The part of the foam that has been entirely charred is dramatically
more fragile than the part that hasn’t.

It’s too bad I didn’t weigh out the ingredients, because this
formulation in particular would have been pretty great to be able to
reproduce.

I think the torch I’m using doesn’t get as hot as the torch I
melted — it’s more for heating larger areas — so I haven’t been able
to get any of these samples above orange heat.  It’ll be good to be
able to verify that they don’t lose structural integrity at higher
temperatures due to, say, too much borax, too much waterglass, or too
much thermal expansion.

The waterglass-based samples I’ve left to dry seem to be leaching
waterglass out the bottom.

The unfired waterglass bodies have hardened noticeably.  Also, two of
them have split, evidently from contracting as the surface dried.

I heated up one of them on the stove flame; it bubbled up pretty much
as before.

Made a giant cookie using the flour/starch/sugar recipe, this time
using baking soda instead of borax (of course), and adding some oil
and vanilla.  Also I added too much water, so I’m frying it in a
skillet instead of baking it.  First conclusion is that this is far
too much leavening for a cookie or pancake.  After cooking, it was
even more inedible than beforehand; the surface caramelized to the
point of being too bitter to eat.  I discarded most of it, retaining a
piece for future torch testing.  Also, I keep belching from the
uncooked batter I ate.  The kitchen definitely smells more appetizing
and less alarming now, though.

Grupo Ecoquimica at Avenida de Mayo 1761 in Ramos Mejía has zinc oxide
(AR$4500/kg), epsom salt (AR$220/kg), mesh-80 calcium carbonate
(AR$80/kg), borax (AR$220/kg), alum (AR$630/kg), citric acid
(AR$290/kg), sulfur (AR$300/kg), bentonite (AR$50/kg), glycerin
(AR$500/kg), kaolin (AR$150/kg), magnesium chloride (AR$210/kg),
dipropylene glycol (AR$528/kg, see file `dipropylene-glycol.md`), soy
lecithin (AR$600/kg), cerium oxide (AR$13200/kg), boric acid
(AR$275/kg), copper sulfate (AR$880/kg), titanium dioxide
(AR$2100/kg), electrode gel (AR$360/kg), talc (AR$200/kg), infusorial
earth (AR$167/kg), etc.  Generally they sell in units of around
AR$300-AR$500, so for most materials the limiting factor would be how
much I could carry.  It’s a few km away.  Kubra and Insumos Nahum have
propylene glycol, these guys don’t, just dipropylene glycol.

Oh, and it looks like the place I bought muriate of lime at the
beginning of the pandemic was Química Industrial Caseros, at Bartolomé
Mitre 4405 in Caseros, which is at the intersection with Lisandro de
la Torre, which intersects Alvear at Día, not where I had thought.  So
that’s why I didn’t find it the other day when I went walking up that
way: I was a few blocks off.

Bought a new can of butane/propane for AR$340 (US$1.90).

The dried inedible pancake fragment, with its extra sugar and oil, and
with baking soda instead of borax, can not only smolder but sustain a
flame for a while after the torch is removed.  Also, it evidently
softens enough to deflect noticeably while the torch is on it.

The other dried/hardened samples (waterglass with starch, waterglass
with starch and borax, flour/sugar/starch/borax) all produce hard
intumescent foams as before.  The waterglass-based samples don’t
smolder.

The massive waterglass/starch/borax sample cracked in a few places on
the outside as its crust shrank while drying.

I ground up a spoonful of some diammonium phosphate fertilizer using
scraps of granite as grindstones, noting an objectionable ammonia
odor; sprinkled it onto some construction sand, previously dried with
a torch, atop a bed of vermiculite; ground up a spoonful of what I
believe to be some aluminum hydroxide, and sprinkled it on top; and
heated the whole lot with the torch for a while.  I never reached an
orange heat for the whole mass, but the fertilizer did bubble out
quite a bit of ammonia, and I often reached an orange heat for the
surface.  At one point I stopped, and the large amount of ammonia that
began to escape persuaded me that stopping had been a bad idea, so I
flambéd the mass a while longer until it stopped bubbling, about 10 or
20 minutes.

Upon cooling, I had a somewhat porous and brittle but surprisingly
strong and hard crust of white material.  It did not show any
water-solubility or acid or base reaction (that is, upon dripping
vinegar on it and letting the vinegar sit for a while, baking soda
sprinkled on it would bubble, so it did not neutralize the vinegar;
but upon being wetted with water, baking soda sprinkled on it would
not bubble, so it did not neutralize the baking soda either.)

It’s probably worth making some better aluminum hydroxide, and trying
the three pairwise combinations of the fertilizer, the construction
sand, and the aluminum hydroxide.

At this point, despite this process having produced some ammonia and
presumably a significant quantity of nitrogen oxides, my lungs were
feeling fine.  I tried heating a piece of the aluminum phosphate (?)
crust thus formed by blowing the torch through the Monster-can “forge”
with the borax/flour/etc. insulation described earlier to see if I
could get it to a higher temperature and maybe melt it.  I did get it
to bubble a bit more, but it didn’t seem to melt bodily.  After
heating it in this way for several minutes, the intumescent insulation
was smoldering pretty enthusiastically, and in places was peeling away
from the can; after removing the gas flame, it sustained a flame for
under a minute, then went back to smoldering.  This left the house
full of smoke that smelled like burnt toast and left my lungs feeling
shitty.

I should probably use one of the non-smoldering, waterglass-based
intumescent recipes.

Still no water-solubility evident from the scrap of aluminum phosphate
(?) in water.

Mina’s impression of the phosphate material was that it felt like a
“fragment of wall”, that is, fully hardened portland-cement concrete
that has exfoliated (maybe because it was improperly adhered stucco).
That seems about right, but I think it might be slightly harder than
that.

I mixed some one-component hardware-store silicone (3M 420
*transparente, vidrios y ventanas* ) with the borax, then mixed by
hand, adding more borax until it seemed like it was going to fall
apart, to get a translucent ball some 25 mm in diameter, around 00:40.
I poked and prodded it to see if it had become elastic or was still
just visco-.

The borax is, I think, too coarsely ground to keep the silicone from
being sticky; so I got sticky silicone all over my fingers, despite
initial attempts to avoid this by using polyethylene bags as gloves.
At least I seem to have avoided getting major skin irritation from the
acetic acid.  I was hoping for more of an Oogoo-style effect, but I
realize that I ① haven’t made Oogoo and ② probably would need to have
the borax finely ground.  The idea at any rate was that maybe the
water of crystallization of the borax would serve as a hydroxyl source
for the silicone polymerization, allowing it to harden all the way
through like Oogoo, and then maybe if the resulting object was heated,
the borate would form a borosilicate network with the silicone
backbones of the polymers.  That evidently didn’t happen.

At 01:00 the ball was still pretty visco- and not very elastic, but at
least it wasn’t sticking to my fingers anymore.  Likewise at 01:24.
The temperature in here is probably around 15°.  By 07:30 the ball was
mostly returning to its initial shape after being squished, and no
longer cracking apart.  My impression is that this is very similar to
the behavior it would have if I had mixed in sand instead of
borax — if it didn’t stick to the sand at all.

(Unfortunately I didn’t bother to note whether it had an acetic-acid
smell at the time.)

I’ve been thinking about how to make these tests more rigorous, having
just read Kingery’s earthshaking dissertation on phosphate-bonded
refractories from 01950; right now I can’t even reliably tell if one
mix is twice as strong or weak as another, or contains twice as much
sand.  It would be great to be able to do quantitative compressive and
flexural strength tests, for example, which would require being able
to cast bars of reproducible dimensions and fire them at reproducible
temperatures.  The tests mentioned previously with the phosphate
fertilizer involved training a somewhat inconstant butane torch on
some material until it stopped bubbling, which took about 20 minutes.

Doing this in a consistent fashion is going to involve setting up some
kind of kiln that can maintain a reproducible temperature, for
probably considerably longer than 20 minutes, since the temperature
has to penetrate to the center of the bar instead of just a
millimeter-thick layer.  See file `pocket-kiln.md` for thoughts on
this.

Also, it would probably be useful to pre-purify the phosphate
fertilizer, maybe using that recrystallization protocol by that
African research group.  And maybe pre-dissociating it to get 99%
crystalline phosphoric acid would be useful for non-intumescent
recipes, and also eliminate the problems associated with ammonia
emissions.  The phosphoric acid would have to be carefully granulated,
though, to prevent it from being a serious inhalation hazard, and if
it overheated (past 42.35°, assuming no freezing point depression from
impurities) it would glom together into just a sticky mass.  And I
don’t have a prilling tower.

Attempted to repeat the production of the apparent aluminum phosphate
without success.  I suspect the sand may have been wet enough to keep
the temperature too low, but stoichiometry is another possible
culprit.  This time I had four areas heated to orange heat at
different times: nothing (just construction sand), possible aluminum
hydroxide, possible aluminum hydroxide with diammonium phosphate, and
just diammonium phosphate.  The grey aluminum compound remained inert
to the heat in both cases; the phosphate bubbled orange as before, but
only produced a cemented mass in the place where it was alone on the
sand, not where it was mixed with the aluminum compound.  This time,
though, the cemented mass was acidic and black, and produced an acid
gas while being flambéd.  The aluminum compound looked for all the
world as if no phosphate had ever been there.  The phosphate flames
were tinted green, a phenomenon I could barely see and hadn’t noticed
before.

The waterglass+borax+starch pieces I’d made previously have become
brittle and fragile as they dried out; I can break a massive (12mm)
bar of it with my thumb, and upon dropping another piece on the floor
it broke.  Also, one piece that had initially hardened on a piece of
PET is off-white on the air side and pure white on the plastic side,
suggesting that the water accumulation I’d observed on that side led
to a permanent chemical difference, perhaps the dissolution of all the
borax.  However, they haven’t developed visible cracks, and they still
form an intumescent refractory foam upon flaming.  It smolders for a
few seconds upon flame removal, though, and upon continued flaming the
foam melts somewhat; this suggests both that the composition doesn’t
contain enough waterglass to suppress smoldering entirely, and that it
doesn’t contain enough carbon to form a continuous carbon network that
can remain solid even when the silicate network melts.

This probably suggests that I should consider using way less borax in
these mixes.  [WP says][0] non-alkaline-earth borosilicate glass is
12–13% boria, alkaline-earth types are 8–12% boria and 5% alkaline
earths and alumina, and high-borate types are 15–25% boria with lower
amounts of alkaline earths and alumina, the remainder being silica in
all cases.  So even a small amount of borax is probably adequate.

I attempted to make three crude pieces of pumice flat by rubbing them
together by hand for about 20 minutes, without external abrasives.
The resulting deviations from flatness over distances of some 30 mm
were on the order of 1 mm.  In one of the three cases this was large
enough to easily detect by touch, which seems to be due to an embedded
hard stone; the other two look and feel flat (except for bubbles),
even in glancing light, until you test them against a really flat
surface.  A great deal of white pumice flour covered the floor, its
adherent nature posing difficulties for broom cleanup; also, it is
slightly gritty between the teeth.  Some of it has gotten into my
keyboard and mouse buttons.

I filled a plastic shopping bag with methane, but to my disappointment
it did not rise into the air, though it did burn nicely, leaving an
unobjectionable candle-wax aroma.  On calculation it seems to be about
a sixteenth of the required volume.  See file `methane-bag.md`.

The borax silicone from four days ago is rubbery all the way through.
Washing it in water reveals that it is spongy and hydrophobic; drops
of water can be squeezed out of its void spaces and bead up on the
surface; evidently the water is washing the borax out of internal
spaces, so it’s like a silicone sponge.  Upon washing it in 95%
ethanol instead, gritty borax comes out on my hands; a drop of water
immediately dissolves it away into slippery wetness, confirming that
it’s borax, or at least something alkaline.  Cutting it in half with a
razor knife makes some white noise as the knife encounters hard grains
and leaves crystalline grains of borax on the razor knife and the
exposed surfaces; they dissolve immediately in water.  So on one hand
there seems to be no uncured silicone, as desired, but on the other
hand the borate mostly doesn’t seem to have been available to interact
with the silicone.  I suspect that probably I used enough crystalline
borax to make the silicone effectively an open-cell foam, with the
pores full of borax, perhaps allowing moisture from the air to
penetrate.  I can’t smell any acetic acid smell, but it *has* been
four days.  Perhaps a better-controlled version of the experiment
would put the silicone and borax inside an airtight membrane, such as
a party balloon or ziploc bag; this would prevent acetic acid from
escaping or moisture from entering.

I mixed some Oogoo in the same way with cassava starch and the same
silicone, inside a pair of polyethylene shopping bags.  It never did
reliably stop being sticky; when there was enough starch on the
surface it would be nonsticky, but sufficient kneading would make it
sticky again.  I have left it to possibly harden.  I was hoping I
could mix it by kneading the inner shopping bag from outside, but
instead I got silicone all over my fingers, which I washed off with
dish detergent and water.  No skin irritation was evident four days
ago, and none is evident now.

After sitting for a while, its surface stopped being sticky at all;
further kneading made it a little sticky again, but I didn’t continue
kneading long enough to see if it returned to its original stickiness.
I just rolled it back into a ball.

A few hours later (4?) the Oogoo thing had thoroughly solidified into
a non-sticky smooth white rubber ball, which bounced nicely.  Slicing
it with the razor knife revealed that it was solidified all the way
through (30–35 mm), so the cassava starch did succeed in avoiding the
standard problem with household one-component silicone where it only
cures in a very thin layer.  It still has a noticeable smell of acetic
acid.

Even though it’s cured all the way through, it’s still noticeably
viscoelastic.

It easily sustains a flame once ignited.  Burning it thoroughly with a
butane torch converted it to a fragile carbon foam slightly larger
than the original rubber, with the surface converted to a white ash,
and produced a slight annoying smell of acid.  The vermiculite near
where it was burned received a gray deposit from the fumes.  I wet
three of the vermiculite stones in a (not pure polypropylene) bottle
cap with a drop of water; baking soda then added did not fizz.  So
whatever the gray stuff is, it’s not noticeably acidic in water.

In the end my lungs hurt for about an hour last night from, I guess,
the smoke from the burning silicone.

[The 3M 420 silicone I’ve been using costs AR$310 for 280 g][1], which
at AR$180/US$ is US$1.72, or US$6.15/kg.  The bisected ball from the
other day weighs 19.0 g, probably half of which is cassava starch
(AR$180/kg or US$1/kg), so this ball cost about AR$3 of material.

We have a glass microwave turntable we’ve been using as a plate, but
it’s not very stable (it tends to tilt one way or the other, or spin
around the middle, because it has three little glass projections near
the center) so I’ve cut part of the ball into three little feet and
glued them onto the bottom with more of the silicone.  We’ll see if
that works.

The Monster can of muriate of lime I dissolved/melted on 02021-07-30
has finally accumulated an appreciable amount of liquid on its surface
by dehydrating the air.

At about 21:15, in one plastic shopping bag I put about 12.0 g cassava
starch and 23.2 g silicone and kneaded them together through the bag,
which produced a mass too sticky to remove from the bag; in another I
similarly mixed 11.8 g silicone with 21.5 g starch, but despite
extensive kneading I cannot get it to cohere into a single mass.  It
just acts like slightly damp cornstarch, easily crumbling away.  I
can’t smell the acetic acid anymore, but I have the impression that
the lower-silicone crumbly version had a lot less acetic aroma to it
at the time.

So I think the silicone-to-starch ratio has to be pretty close to 1:1;
neither 2:1 nor 1:2 works well.  I might try a third batch where I
start with a ball of silicone in a vast oversupply of starch, then
progressively knead in more starch, then measure how much starch
remains unincorporated once I’ve produced a reasonable product.  That
seems like it might work better than trying to knead it through the
bag.  Like how you flour your hands when kneading bread.

After an hour and a half, though, at 22:47, I can peel the 12g-starch,
23.2-g silicone mix off the bag and roll it into a ball, which weighs
30.2 g out of the 35.2 g originally placed.  So there’s probably about
5.0 g of silicone (and starch) still stuck to the bag that I didn’t
manage to peel off.  The ball is still annoyingly sticky to the touch.
I can smell the acetic acid again, and it’s sort of chokingly strong.

After another half hour, at 23:13, the ball is no longer fully
plastic; it tends to return to its original form after even fairly
extreme deformations, so it is no longer kneadable.  If this is
typical behavior it’s fairly annoying: it went from annoyingly sticky
on the hands half an hour ago to unworkable now.  I wonder if a larger
amount of starch would mitigate this behavior, because the ball last
night was a lot more kneadable when reasonably unsticky.  But maybe I
just got lucky?

My fingers sure do feel smooth.

I mixed some more sodium silicate with cassava starch on another
shopping bag to form a dough, which I tried to use to form a little
pocket oven.  This was unsuccessful, as over the following 20 minutes
the oven gradually slumped down into a flat object; evidently sodium
silicate with cassava starch behaves as a very viscous fluid, not a
viscoelastic solid.  Maybe gelatinizing the starch first would help.

I flambéd a small piece of it with the butane torch.  It produced a
little bit of smoke, which smelled like pine pitch — Mina reported
that it smelled like mentholated wood.  Upon long flaming it was able
to remain smoldering for a few seconds after the flame source was
removed, but not sustain a flame on its own.  The carbonizing stuff
swelled up like a sopaipilla in the torch flame.  I was mostly able to
hold it just in my fingers even though it was only a few cm long; at
some points I resorted to needlenose pliers, which broke through the
surface and exposed the hollow interior.

Mina reports that the sodium silicate bottle has a very strong smell
resembling that of toilet cleaner (the kind based on muriatic acid),
one which provoked nausea.  I can’t smell anything from it, but I
suppose there must be a lot of hydroxyls flying around if she can.

In between the hydroxyls from the sodium silicate, the acetic acid
from the Oogoo, and the pine-scented smoke from the intumescent, we’re
both kind of clearing our throats a lot.

By 00:00 the Oogoo seemed to be fully hardened but of course still
preserves a quite strong acetic-acid aroma.  I stuck a hardened steel
shaft through it.

To estimate the water content of the liquid that had formed on the
muriate salt, I took a shiny steel bowl (nickel-plated?) weighing
42.3 g and poured the salt solution out of the Monster can, bringing
the weight to 47.3 g, so about 5.0 g of liquid had formed.  Then I
heated the bowl on the stove until it was apparently just dry white
deposits of muriate of lime, though a little hissing was still
audible.  At this point the bowl weighed 45.0 g, so only about 2.7 g
of muriate of lime remained; 2.3 g of water had boiled away.  (Also, a
little bit had been thrown out of the bowl by the violent sizzling
bubbling — white specks were visible all around the rim of the bowl,
so some must have also overshot.)  After strongly heating the bowl on
the stove a few minutes more, bringing parts of its floor to red heat
while covering the top of it partly with aluminum foil, turning parts
of the shiny nickel (?) black, producing a strong smell of metal, it
still weighed 45.0 g, so if more water was lost, it was compensated by
oxidation of the bowl.  After washing the bowl with water, during
which a bunch of the black stuff came off onto my fingers (NiCl₂?  But
that would be green and water-soluble.  CrCl₃?  Would be purple (but
maybe I wouldn’t notice the difference)) and drying it, the bowl
weighed 42.2 g, so evidently there wasn’t a lot of oxidation going on,
so probably the white stuff from when it boiled dry was pretty much
just the anhydrous salt, as you’d expect.

That would mean 2.3 g of water was enough to hydrate and dissolve
2.7 g of anhydrous muriate of lime, so something is clearly wrong
here!  According to file `shower-heating-tces.md` the solid
hexahydrate should weigh 219.07/110.98 of the anhydrate form, or
5.3 g/2.7 g, so 2.6 g of water should have been required just to get
to the hexahydrate.  Moreover Wikipedia says the hexahydrate only
dissolves 81.1 g per 100 mℓ of water at 25°, so to dissolve those
5.3 g we should have needed 11.9 g of total solution, another 6.6 g of
water, or more at temperatures below 25°.  It’s definitely cold enough
here for the hexahydrate to solidify.

I’m not sure where my error is exactly.  The Wikipedia numbers predict
that 11.9 g of saturated hexahydrate solution should have been
required to boil down to 2.7 g, not 5.0 g.  Given how exactly the
scale was able to reproduce previous measurements, it hardly seems
likely that it had a 6.9 g error in measuring the weight of the
solution I dripped into it, even if maybe it does have a little bit of
silicone on the table under it.  It measures the blob of Oogoo at
30.8 g, the one it measured as 30.2 g a few hours ago, but also I
think a little more Oogoo got stuck to the ball after I initially
weighed it.  Maybe this stuff isn’t really muriate of lime — but then,
what else *could* it be?

I should probably see whether, say, 20 g of salt from the bag loses
mass if I heat it to red heat, and then how much water it takes to
start to dissolve it at room temperature, which should tell me how
much mass the hexahydrate has.

Interestingly, when I pulled the shaft out of the Oogoo to weigh it,
it left a perfectly round hole through the middle of the blob.  I
guess it’s still flowing a little bit (or creeping a lot, depending on
how you look at it).  It’s 01:22, and I’ve stuck the original shaft
back in, and I’m sticking a second shaft through it to see if the hole
*it* made remains open, or round, when I pull it out tomorrow.

02021-08-14
-----------

It took a couple of hours for the respiratory irritation to die down.

The Oogoo is noticeably harder this afternoon.  The second shaft left
a hole smaller than the first, about half the diameter (maybe 1mm
instead of 2mm; the calipers say the shafts are 2.94–2.98 mm, so I
think that even the first hole is smaller than the shaft that made
it); I’ve taken both shafts out and inserted one of them to make a
third hole.  It still smells of acetic acid.

The waterglass starch dough has mostly hardened in the position I left
it in.  It occurred to me that last night it was flowing liquidly when
left alone for long periods of time, while breaking brittlely when I
tried to form it rapidly, which is pretty much the shear-thickening
behavior you’d expect for a suspension of starch in water, just at
lower flow rates.

We found a stone mortar that had been missing.  It was in the kitchen
cabinet.  Unfortunately, vinegar testing on the bottom shows that it’s
marble, not agate, so it will contaminate anything ground in it with
marble dust.  Nevertheless I will grind some of the borax.  Agate
mortars are [available for around US$800][2], which seems excessive
when a [chunk of agate of the right size is only US$30][3].

[3]: https://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-744508347-piedra-agata-en-bruto-natural-art517-_JM

I used the mortar to grind some borax to a mostly flour-like
consistency.  I weighed it into the same bowl I used yesterday, which
now weighs 42.3 g; after taring the bowl, the borax weighs 52.5 g.  I
took a Nutella jar which weighs 30.2 g; upon adding the borax, it
weighs 82.6 g, giving a 52.4 g weight of finely ground borax.  I’d
probably need to screen the borax to separate out the remaining large
crystals I missed in the grinding.

The borax tastes like baking soda (something I haven’t been brave
enough to try previously) but does not bubble in vinegar.  After
adding vinegar to it, baking soda that is added still fizzes, but very
slowly, which is consistent with the borax having converted the
vinegar into sodium acetate and much weaker boric acid.

To try Oogoo with a little of this new finer borax, I mixed 10.2 g of
cassava starch with 0.5 g of this flour-ground borax in the bowl, then
transferred it to a shopping bag.  In another bag, I mixed 10.3 g of
cassava starch with 2.0 g of the same borax.  To the shopping bag with
the 0.5 g of borax I added 10.4 g of the same silicone; to the other
bag with the 2.0 g of borax I added 13.2 g.  In both cases I smooshed
them around by kneading them through the bag until they seemed pretty
uniform.  Now it’s 01:48 by the laptop clock.

The idea is that the borax may do one or more of: provide borate ions
that cross-link the silicone to make it harder; neutralize the acetic
acid into sodium acetate, converting the borax itself into relatively
inert boric acid, thus reducing the annoying outgassing; or release
extra water, speeding the acetic cure.  And by being more finely
ground, maybe it will work better for these things than last time, and
also not add so much porosity to the final material as my first borax
silicone test on 02021-08-08.

At only 01:56 (8 minutes later) the two Oogoo batches are noticeably
harder.  I can already peel them off the bags.  The ball from the
other bag (with 2.0 g of borax) weighs 25.8 g, rather than the
2+13.2+10.3=25.5 g expected, suggesting a weighing error.  The ball
from the shopping bag weighs 20.9 g rather than the
0.5+10.4+10.2=21.1 g expected.  I think I left more of the silicone
stuck to the very thin shopping bag because it was harder to peel the
bag away from the silicone, perhaps because it was much more wrinkly.
But I guess it probably wasn’t more than about 3%.

It’s 02:09 now, 21 minutes after initial mixing, and the two chunks of
Oogoo are very moldable and kneadable and still kind of annoyingly
sticky, but at least they’re not leaving chunks of silicone stuck all
over my fingers any more.  They both have a strong acetic acid smell.
So far, there’s no evidence that the borax has had any effect.  That
does sort of mean that it was ground finely enough to eliminate the
obvious grittiness I had in the first borax silicone test.  I took
advantage of the kneadability to fold each one in half 20 times to mix
them more homogeneously.

At 02:20, 32 minutes after initial mixing, they’re still very moldable
and kneadable, and noticeably less sticky.  The two versions seem
pretty identical though.  Most of the acetic-acid smell seems to be
gone from the shopping-bag ball, the one with only 0.5 g of borax.
Both balls look wet when being left without kneading for a few
minutes, suggesting that the silicone is smoothing out rough surfaces
with viscous flow.  Kneading makes them look dry for a little while.

I think I’ll try kneading some construction sand into part of one of
the balls.  I dried some sand in the bowl, which weighed 70.7 g with
the dry sand, and thus this is about 28.4 g of sand.  I’m pulling off
about half the other-bag ball, 11.9 of 25.8 g of Oogoo.  After having
kneaded in sand to 21.4 g (presumably 9.5 g of sand) it was starting
to have noticeably less structural integrity, but I managed to
incorporate essentially all the sand and still have a brown plastic
mass weighing 39.0 g.  I must have lost about 1.3 g of sand along the
way.  Mina commented that it felt like whole-wheat flour.

As plastic molding compounds go, this sand mix is not quite as cheap
as pottery clay, but it’s probably watertight once it hardens at room
temperature, and it wouldn’t be surprising if it were enormously more
impact-resistant as well, though weaker and softer.  The proportions
are, I think:

10.3 g cassava starch × 11.9/25.8 = 4.8 g (12%)  
2.0 g borax × 11.9/25.8 = 0.92 g (2.4%)   
13.2 g silicone × 11.9/25.8 = 6.1 g (16%)  
27.1 g sand (70%)  
39.0 g total  

1 kg of the stuff would cost 2.1¢ for the sand (US$0.03/kg according
to file `refractories.md`), 98¢ for the silicone, 7¢ for the borax at
US$3/kg, and 12¢ for the cassava starch, for a total of US$1.19/kg.

It’s now 02:52 by my laptop clock.  It’s still possible to fold the
Oogoo over on itself an arbitrary number of times, but there’s
noticeably more resistance, and quite a bit of elasticity, where it
tends to return partway to its previous form.  So at 64 minutes past
initial mixing it’s already past its prime for molding.

My hands and upper respiratory system were a little irritated last
night; some of my fingers itched.  I suspect exposure to acetic acid
exacerbated by a lot of handwashing was to blame.

It’s 19:17.

All three Oogoo samples from last night are fairly hard, as rubbers
go.  The sand-filled silicone is noticeably harder than the other two,
which otherwise seem pretty similar.  An acetic-acid smell is evident
from all three.

Attempting to cut the sand-filled silicone with a razor knife quickly
destroy the knife, within a few millimeters.  I think that if I were
to push it hard enough I could probably get it to keep cutting,
because I can cut the stuff with my thumbnail.  However, it’s rubbery
enough that when I let go of the cut piece, it flaps back into place.
Note that this is very different from the behavior I predicted for
sand-filled silicone on 02021-08-08, when the borax didn’t stick to
the silicone.

The sand-filled silicone definitely wets with water better than the
other silicones.  I haven’t measured a contact angle or anything,
though.  When heated up to 100° in a boiling-water bath, it wets
completely with water.

At 19:55, I’ve been boiling the sand-filled silicone for about half an
hour.  It seems slightly changed: the surface feels slimy and leaves a
slimy substance on the fingers, and it no longer smells of vinegar.
But it feels about as hard as before.

I think the seal made between the 2.94-mm ground hardened steel shaft
and the 2-mm-or-so hole it made in the 02021-08-13 Oogoo (2 hours and
45 minutes after being mixed) amounts to a usable sliding seal.  It’s
easy to spin the shaft with the fingers when it’s pressed through the
silicone, and I’m reasonably sure that the hydrophobic nature of the
silicone would keep water from sneaking past it.  You’d want to use a
thinner silicone washer in practice than the 30+ mm.  A casual test
with a drop of water on the slice of that block of Oogoo suggests that
this would work, but of course that doesn’t tell us anything about how
much pressure the seal could withstand.

Mina discovered that the Oogoo from 02021-08-13 is capable of erasing
pencil marks from paper, much to my surprise.  In fact, it seems to
work better than a normal pencil eraser, although the graphite remains
on the surface of the silicone instead of being carried away in
crumbs.  But getting the stuff to flake off in crumbs is presumably
just a matter of adding enough of some kind of friable filler or
filler with poor adhesion to the silicone, like the borax-filled
silicone on 02021-08-08 that ended up making a fragile sponge.

At 20:22 the sand-filled silicone has been out of the boiling water
for nearly half an hour but still feels wet.  I suspect I gelatinized
the remaining starch in its surface layer, and that’s now retaining
water, and smears off on your fingers when you rub it on them.  Rubbed
on a wine bottle, it leaves a visible smear which does not wipe off
with a dry paper towel, but does wipe off with a wet one, suggesting
that it is indeed some kind of water-soluble thing like gelatinized
starch.  It still feels the same way another hour later, at 21:31.  I
wonder if it will grow mold (you’d think the borax would prevent that,
but the borax might have been leached out of the surface layer by the
boiling).

This slimy water-soluble stuff makes me wonder if maybe with so much
starch the stuff might not be waterproof even at room temperature.  It
might be worth trying a wider range of ratios and fillers.

A permanent marker (Du Hu brand, UPC 9-930691-011013) easily marks the
Oogoo (tried on the two sand-free samples from last night and the one
from the other day), but it easily rubs off.  A smiley face thus drawn
on one of the Oogoo balls rubbed onto paper transfers onto the paper,
suggesting the possibility of flexographic offset printing with this
material.

By 02:41 the sand-filled Oogoo had stopped feeling wet on the top side
(and stopped depositing water-soluble slime on wine bottles when
rubbed) but still felt wet on the bottom (and still deposited slime).

The 39 grams of sand-filled Oogoo had dried out by this afternoon.  I
pounded the crap out of it with a hammer against some bricks (maybe 20
hammer blows of 50 J each); it crumbled somewhat and became softer and
porous, but mostly retained its structural integrity.  The only pieces
that came off were due to a couple of hammer blows where the corner of
the hammer punched all the way through it into the brick on the other
side.  The surfaces are now whiter and rougher.  It now weighs 38.0 g,
and I regret not having weighed it before pounding it with the hammer,
because I suspect that most of that weight loss was from boiling
starch out of its surface, not from hammering damage.

This seems like noticeably worse impact toughness than I would
normally expect from this kind of silicone, but then again, this
object is only 16% silicone by weight.  It’s kind of in the ballpark
for what I’d expect from non-ferrous metals, although of course this
impact toughness was achieved mostly through large deformations rather
than large stiffness.

As I suspected yesterday, I can cut through the stuff with a razor
knife just by pushing it hard enough through the material if I
carefully avoid sawing back and forth, which immediately destroys the
edge of the razor knife.  By contrast, the knife edge is mostly intact
when I just push through, though not without nicks from the sand.
Pushing hard even works when the knife edge has been thus dulled by
sawing, although it requires more force.

Using the unsharpened *back* of the razor knife, I can cut through the
pumice quite readily — not quite as readily as cutting soft materials
like cardboard or silicone, but very nearly.  This further reinforces
my impression that Foams Are A Miracle.
