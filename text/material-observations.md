Some notes on some things I tried.

Pouring sodium silicate solution into concentrated oil of lime hardens
the surface enough that it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the yogurt
cup, and you can pick up the resulting ooze by hand.  Placing the ooze
on a bed of vermiculite and pouring hot construction sand (300°?) over
it produces foamed glass, which grows over a longer period of time
than the foamed glass produced from dried waterglass, but with about
the same density.  However, it sticks to the sand and vermiculite as
it grows.

Having burned through a cotton towel when pouring hot sand previously,
I used a steel wool pad as a hotpad in this case, which worked fine.
Obviously there are drawbacks to using such inflammable materials as
insulating refractory, but in this case it didn’t ignite, and it
worked fine to protect my fingers.

Having melted the aluminum parts of the previous butane-torch nozzle
(the kind that uses 227-gram cans of butane), I bought a somewhat more
robust one from the hardware store for US$6, with no evident aluminum
or plastic parts and no striker.  This can produce a substantially
more exciting flame.

### Borax ###

Bought some 700 g borax from the hardware store for some US$2.  Smells
slightly acidic, suggesting it’s maybe contaminated with boric acid.
It successfully cross-links PVA glue (“plasticola”) into an insoluble
mass.  A hot wire causes it to adhere readily; application of heat
causes it to foam up quite a bit, suggesting that it’s quite hydrated,
and then collapse down into a glassy layer of, presumably, mostly
boria, which seems to be able to mostly dissolve construction sand
when reheated.  This suggests that it really is borax.

Heating the borax on low heat on the stove on some aluminum foil
produces a prodigious amount of white solid foam, similar to the
intumescent foam from sodium silicate (see file `glass-foam.md`),
which can be cut with a hot wire.  A drop of water on this foam has no
immediately obvious effect, but after a few minutes, has dissolved a
hole some 30 mm in diameter.

### Quartz-halogen bulbs ###

The internal bulb in one of these halogen household bulbs can be
heated to an orange heat in the butane torch without any softening,
and even quenching in water does not crack them.  This strongly
suggests that it really is quartz.  Too bad it’s burned out.  These
bulbs are hard to find nowadays, though some vendors have some
remaining stock for under US$1 each, and 150W–500W exterior halogen
floodlights still cost only US$2–US$4.

The replacement headlight bulb I got from an auto parts store (US$3)
has the same behavior, except that I haven’t tried quenching it,
suggesting that it’s also a quartz-halogen bulb.  (Also, the box
carries a pictorial warning against touching the glass.)  This is a
Magneti Marelli “H7 12V 55W PX26d”.  Cold (10°?) it measures some 7Ω
on a shitty multimeter that measures 3Ω short-circuit, demonstrating
why household 240V quartz-halogen bulbs would be better for use as
RTDs.  When reheated to orange-hot, it measures 2Ω but the meter's
short-circuit resistance has dropped to 1Ω, demonstrating that the
meter is totally inadequate for this purpose.  For heating-element
purposes such a bulb ought to be adequate up to nearly 1000°.

### Pumice and garden stores ###

I bought 10 liters of off-white pumice from the garden store for US$2.
It’s so porous that it floats, but it’s open-cell enough that
sometimes it becomes waterlogged and sinks after a few seconds.  It
seems to weigh about 3.5 kg.  Stone dimensions are on the order of
10–40 mm.  It can be heated to orange heat in the blowtorch without
apparent change.  A hacksaw cuts it almost as easily as wood; a steel
wire can bore a hole through it far more easily than through wood, and
without cracking it in half.  It can be easily sanded on granite or on
other pumice stones, yielding a fine floury dust.

Though there is significant variation, it’s too hard to crush between
my fingers, break with my fingers, or carve with thumbnails in its
default form, though you can drill through it with a bamboo chopstick
and enough effort.  However, heating it to orange heat in the
blowtorch renders it somewhat more fragile (presumably by thermal
shock inducing microfractures), so that it can be broken by hand,
though still not crushed between my fingers.  Simply soaking it in
water does not have such a weakening effect, but quenching it in water
after such heating weakens the stone to an even greater degree.

One stone weighs 6.7 g.  When added to 151.3 g of tap water (including
yogurt cup), the reading was 158.1, a reading of 6.8 g.  Later the
reading was 157.9, and upon depressing it below the surface of the
water with wires, 159.1, suggesting 1.2 cc of volume out of the water,
or some 7.9 cc of total volume.  Upon removing the wet stone from the
water, the reading dropped from 158.0 to 150.2, a difference of 7.8 g,
and the wet stone weighed 7.7 g, suggesting there was 1.05 g of water
in its pore volume.  This suggests a total volume, including pore
volume around 9.0 cc and thus a dry density of 0.74 g/cc.

I stopped by a grow shop and was disappointed to find very little in
the way of pure fertilizers and pesticides, less even than in the
local garden store.

### Carbonates and phosphates of iron ###

The garden-store green vitriol looks quite pure, though clumping
together like a gorgeous green deliquescent thing, but the solution in
tap water is a bit cloudy.  Adding an excess of baking soda produces,
after a while, voluminous green-brown bubbles that grow quite large
and do not pop, overflowing my inadequate yogurt cup.  A gray-green
gritty slime with a smell like metal precipitates; this is probably a
mix of carbonates and hydroxides of iron.  Effervescence continues for
an hour or more; probably boiling the soda first would have avoided
it.  Adding diammonium phosphate fertilizer instead in solid form
produces no visible reaction at first, but upon heating produces a
milky white precipitate, which later proceeds to form convection cells
like those in miso soup.

### Iron products ###

Neither of the insoluble iron preparations have defecated to anything
like transparency.  Gravity filtration of the carbonate through a
coffee filter leaves a dark green-brown mud on the filter and a fairly
cloudy filtrate, which defecates.  The mud smells like sulfur or
metal, but the filtrate smells like dust.  A second filtration still
leaves a cloudy filtrate.

The phosphate is instead partly white, partly gray, with some solid
chunks which presumably result from the green vitriol remineralizing
the fertilizer prills without letting them completely dissolve.  It
has a similar metallic/sulfurous smell, and similarly the filtrate
through coffee filters is cloudy.  No ammonia smell is detectable.
Excitingly, some of the phosphate product required a bit of work with
a chopstick to scrape free of the epoxy (?) liner of the aluminum can.
But this may have been because I overheated it when heating the
mixture.  I should maybe recrystallize some of the ammonium phosphate
and figure out some of the stoichiometry.

### Pumice grinding ###

Grinding the surface of the pumice with, for example, bamboo, tends to
make the surface harder and less porous, because it fills the exposed
bubbles with packed powder.  When a hole thus drilled with a bamboo
chopstick has recently broken through, there is greater risk of
breaking the rock by wedging.

### Muriate of lime ###

Put 108.0 g of water in a 10.9 g cut-off can and started heating it up
gently.  Too bad I don’t have a thermometer.  After heating to boiling
it weighed 117.8 g.  Adding (hopefully anhydrous) muriate of lime it
had all dissolved up to a total weight of 235 g.  At 282.0 g total
weight some of the crystals remained undissolved, but then did
dissolve, with a weight gain to 287.6 g.  I added more crystals to
322.1 g and a little bit seems undissolved; gentle heating dissolved
them, reducing the weight to 321.9 g.  Adding more crystals to get up
to 341.9 g leaves some crystals undissolved.  Further gentle heating
leaves weight at 341.6 and dissolves all crystals; adding more
crystals to 366.0 g leaves some crystals undissolved at first.
Further gentle heating dissolves all crystals and leaves the weight at
364.1 g; adding more crystals brings the weight to 387.5 g.
Further gentle heating dissolves all crystals and leaves the weight at
385.3 g; I added more crystals to 442.2 g.

And then I gave up.  I think those dissolved too.  I’m letting it cool
now; a thin crust of solid has formed at the surface, preventing
further evaporation.

After a couple of hours, the material in the can has the appearance of
a solid, transparent block, but this is an illusion; once the crust is
broken, the inside can be seen to be a mix of rather jagged crystals
of muriate of lime and warm, syrupy oil of lime, which stick nicely to
the finger.

### NightHawkInLight’s intumescent refractory ###

Now I have borax so I should be able to make resistant carbonizing
intumescent refractory materials.  [One person reports success][1]
with 10 tsp cornstarch, 1 tsp baking soda, 4 tsp PVA glue, and no
extra water.  [NightHawkInLight is reported by WP][2] to have switched
from this recipe to cornstarch, flour, sugar, and borax, which was
less prone to mold; in [his video on the improved formulation][3] he
explains (3'47"):

> I’ve also found an optional ingredient that adds both mold and
> insect resistance, as well as an improvement I did *not* expect,
> which I’ll talk about in a moment.  These are the ingredients i used
> in my improved composition: 40 grams of flour, then 20 grams each of

> together with approximately 25 grams of water creates a workable
> dough.
> 
> It may seem like a lousy cookie recipe, but each of these

> formula entirely.

At this point he shows his notebook with something like eight alternative recipes:

- 5 g baking soda, 10 g borax, 10 g sugar, 5 g corn starch, 25 g
  flour, 5 g diatomaceous earth;
- 50 g corn starch, 25 g erythritol, 25 g ammonium diphosphate [sic] +
  shellac as a possible coating;
- 10 g sugar, 20 g flour, 10 g borax, and “mod + 5 g baking soda”.  A
  second column says that using 10 g flour instead of 20, it was “a
  little melty”.
- On an earlier page, .5 g alum, 2 g iron phos[phate], 2.5 g flour; or
- 3 g iron phos[phate], 1 g urea, 3 g alum, 1 g “cs” (cornstarch?), 16 g
  flour, 2 g sugar; marked “almost as good →” with an arrow pointing to:
- “Best”: 10 g corn starch, 20 g flour, 10 g baking soda (or borax, as
  suggested by a video edit), 10 g powdered sugar, 25 g water for 2×
  batch; one Xed out column instead suggests 10 g corn starch, 50 g
  flour, 20 g baking soda, 20 g powdered sugar; a third column
  suggests 5 g corn starch, 25 g flour, 10 g baking soda, and 10 g
  powdered sugar.  And, finally,
- 1 g “Kno3” (!), 2 g iron II phosphate, 10 g corn starch, 20 g flour,
  10 g sugar, 20 g water.

So, I guess I’ll try his recommended recipe: 40 g flour, 20 g corn
starch, 20 g sugar, 20 g borax, and 25 g water.

I mixed:

- 40.2 g 000 white flour (Cañuelas brand)
- 20.4 g borax
- 20.0 g sugar (granulated, Ledesma azúcar común tipo “A”, freely
  flowing and so apparently fairly dry)
- 20.4 g manioc starch (I couldn’t find the cornstarch)
- 37.4 g water (I poured too fast and overshot by 50%)

The total ball of dough was 133.9 g, so I probably lost about 4.5 g
that stuck to the mixing container or my hands or whatever.  It
smelled like cookie dough and had a tendency to kind of slump,
probably due to having too much water.  I was able to use it to cover
the inside of a Monster can with the ends cut off and heat the can
from the inside with the hand butane torch, and it did indeed foam up
and produce an aroma similar to burnt toast and a carbon foam similar
in hardness to insulating firebrick.

After letting the can cool, I turned the flame back on and ran it
through the can again while holding it between my fingers; after about
30 seconds, the can became too hot to hold comfortably.

I heated up a small, thin piece (initially on a bed of waterglass
foam, then inside the Monster-can “forge”) to see if I could cook it
thoroughly into foam to get some kind of read on its material
properties.  During this process I noticed a second objectionable
feature of this composition, aside from the burnt-toast smoke: it has
a tendency to continue to smolder for a while after the source of heat
is removed.  (I wrapped the piece in aluminum foil to put it out
without wetting it.)  Also, significant cracks were opening up in the
lining of the Monster can, although they seem to have been exposing
uncooked dough rather than unprotected aluminum.

After all that, the piece turned out to be under 100 mg and so too
small for my shitty scale to weigh, even when wet.  It floated in
water mostly below the surface, similar to the pumice, but it’s hard
to tell how much of that is a question of water absorption.

In terms of fragility, it is definitely less fragile than the
waterglass foam, and definitely more fragile than pumice.

Heating some more of this stuff with he blowtorch on top of the
waterglass foam, I notice that each little black particle has a little
crater around it in the waterglass foam, like snow around de-icing
salt on a sidewalk.  This suggests that either the carbon particles
are producing heat to melt the waterglass around them, for example by
burning (quite possible), or that the borax in them is fluxing the
waterglass foam and allowing it to soften and collapse at a lower
temperature (also possible).

One of the resulting chunks of carbon foam ranges from 15 mm in
thickness to 25 mm in length and weighs 1.0 g.

Density measurement: I placed a 64.5 g cup of water on the scale.
Immersing the foam in it beneath the surface with chopsticks yielded a
reading of 68.1 g; removing it produced a reading of 61.8 g; weighing
the foam separately yielded 3.7; immersing it a second time produced a
reading of 67.8; weighing it a second time produced a weight of 4.0; a
final weighing of the cup produced a reading of 61.4.  Apparently in
the first immersion it absorbed 2.7 g of water (both the difference in
the foam and in the water), having displaced 3.6 cc of water; after
the second immersion it had absorbed 3.0–3.1 g of water and was
displacing 3.3 cc of water.  So its total volume was 6.3 cc, including
both the pore spaces that filled with water and those that excluded
water, but not including spaces from which the water drained
immediately upon removal.  This is a pretty reasonable volume, given
that 15 mm × 20 mm × 25 mm would have been 7.5 cc, and the shape was
quite irregular.  So the density of the foam as such is about
0.16 g/cc.

The water in this process turned dirty brown and had lots of black
crap floating in it, so presumably there was a significant amount of
lost mass.  On soaking the foam a little longer, the water turned
quite black.

After driving the water off from the foam that hasn’t dissolved with
the torch, it weighed 800 mg, so only about 20% was lost.

I’ve flattened out a remaining piece of the dough to let it air-dry so
that I can test its intumescent properties after drying.

### Waterglass and starch intumescent refractory ###

It occurs to me that a 1:1 molar ratio of carbon sources such as
cornstarch with silicon sources such as waterglass might be able to
produce a foam that is partly or wholly carborundum (melting point
2830°), which would have mechanical and oxidation-resistance
properties superior to carbon foam, and mechanical and melt-resistance
properties superior to silicate glass foams.  Boron carbide B₄C would
probably be superior (harder than carborundum, softer only than CBN
and diamond) but I think it’s probably even harder to produce than
carborundum; Moissan’s original synthesis involved heating boria with
carbon over the melting point of boron carbide, 2763°, though
apparently magnesium permits the reaction under much less violent
conditions.

Mixing a little waterglass with manioc starch produces a mixture with
the consistency of warm chewing gum; I kept adding starch and kneading
it in until it seemed like adding more starch would make it fall
apart.  (But I don’t know whether this is 1:3, 1:1, 3:1, or what.)
The resulting rubbery, doughy substance is intumescent under the
flame, producing a black foam with similar strength to that of the
borax-based recipe above, though perhaps with a smaller cell size,
but, as I was hoping, this foam has no tendency to smolder.  Also,
perhaps unsurprisingly, it stuck rather tightly to the foamed
waterglass bed I was trying to heat it on, which the carbon/borax foam
did not.  I’ve left a fragment of this composition also to dry.  While
intumescing it produced a scent vaguely reminiscent of pine pitch,
which strikes me as slightly alarming.

Both this foam and the waterglass-free version can be very readily cut
with a hacksaw.

### Waterglass, borax, and starch intumescent refractory ###

It occurred to me that maybe borax would be compatible with
waterglass, and indeed you can mix quite a lot of borax and water into
this waterglass solution without coagulating it in the way calcium or
magnesium ions do.  (I was concerned that perhaps the borate ions
would be sufficiently amphiphilic to cross-link the silicate, but
apparently not.)  Mixing up manioc starch as before with this mixture
produces another white doughy mixture which produces intumescent black
foam when heated — though there are also bits of white foam, which may
have been undissolved borax crystals.  I’ve left a couple of these
samples also to dry and see how they behave.  One I heated
immediately; it also has the unnerving pine-resin smell, and the foam
it produces is the hardest yet — I can barely carve it with my
thumbnail.  I ran out of butane for the torch in the process, so I
heated the sample for a longer period of time on the kitchen stove’s
gas flame.  Hacksawing through it reveals that although it has foamed
up throughout its thickness, only the outermost 5 mm charred, leaving
an inner circle of white uncharred material separated from the
fissured outer carbon foam by a brown ring.

As with the waterglass/starch mix, the foam shows no tendency to
smolder.

I can still break this foam material by hand, but it is hard enough
that I cannot crush it between my fingers.  Taking a 12-mm-diameter
bit of it that weighs in at 0.65 g, I tried repeating the earlier
density measurement but screwed up my measurements; I think the water
weighs 81.9 g after pulling the wet foam out, 83.6 with it immersed,
and the wet foam weighs 1.6 g.  Or maybe it’s 80.7 g after the foam is
removed.  So it absorbed 0.95 g of water and displaced 1.7–2.9 g,
which is really a damned wide range, so its volume including pores is
2.65–3.85 cc.  Which is totally impossible, because (12mm)³ =
1.728 cc, so it’s somewhere in the range 0.17–0.72 g/cc.  Not a good
measurement by any stretch of the imagination.  All you can say is
that it floats if it’s dry.  It turns out that it floats if it’s wet,
too, barely, so I guess it’s below 0.4 g/cc dry.

So, I’ll have to redo the test with a larger piece, maybe after I get
more butane.

The part of the foam that has been entirely charred is dramatically
more fragile than the part that hasn’t.

It’s too bad I didn’t weigh out the ingredients, because this
formulation in particular would have been pretty great to be able to
reproduce.

I think the torch I’m using doesn’t get as hot as the torch I
melted — it’s more for heating larger areas — so I haven’t been able
to get any of these samples above orange heat.  It’ll be good to be
able to verify that they don’t lose structural integrity at higher
temperatures due to, say, too much borax, too much waterglass, or too
much thermal expansion.

The waterglass-based samples I’ve left to dry seem to be leaching
waterglass out the bottom.
