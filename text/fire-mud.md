Some comments in a book on ayurvedic alchemy led me to think about
possible formulas for castable refractory.

The Rasajalanidhi of Bhudeb Mookerji and its “fire mud”
-------------------------------------------------------

[The Rasa-jala-nidhi][6] [describes part of the preparation of a
nabhi-yantra or jala-yantra][0] as follows (p. 272, 307 of 406, Bhudeb
Mookerji, M.A., Vol. 1, [published in 01926][7]):

> ...plaster the joint by means of the following paste, which serves

It doesn’t really say what the proportions of the chalk, salt,
oxidized iron, and buffalo’s milk are; [WP says buffalo milk][1] is a
bit higher in everything (except water, I suppose) than cow’s milk.  I
suspect this mixture will form hematite cemented with hydroxyapatite
and contaminated with salt and carbon when heated — that the milk
serves as a source of phosphates, which combine with the calcium from
the chalk to form hydroxyapatite, as well as protein and sugar which
act as low-temperature binders; then, at higher temperatures, the
protein cross-links and forms a thermoset, holding the fire mud in
shape until all the organics have been converted to carbon with a
little nitrogen.  I suspect the salt is just present as a catalyst and
the iron oxide as an inert aggregate that is stable at high
temperatures.

In other parts of the book (e.g., Vol. 1, p. 41 (76/406), or on p. 10)
he does give precise proportions of ingredients by weight.

I do not regard the author of this “translation” as entirely reliable;
much of his book is concerned with procedures for transforming base
metals into gold, silver, and copper, a process he says he has had
demonstrated to him by his preceptor and is confident he could carry
out himself given the appropriate equipment; moreover he claims that
the human race is 1.6 billion years old.  The book he “translates”
from Sanskrit says it is written by one Bhudeba of the Mukhopadhyaya
family, descendant of the sage Bharadwaja who, nine hundred thousand
years ago, brought to India the science of medicine; his parents are
Harilala Deba and Nistarini Debi; and on the next page he explains
that Mukhopadhyaya is “generally written in English for the sake of
brevity” as “Mookerji”.

That is, the book is written in Sanskrit by Bhudeba Mookerji and
translated into English by Bhudeb Mookerji.  He says the book is
“based on many of those which are still extant”, but is written in
“year 5026 of the perverted [Kalijuga][8]”.  The Kali Yuga started on
February 17/18 in 03102 BCE, so year 5026 is most of 01925 CE and a
little of 01926.  So unfortunately it is impossible to know whether
this “fire mud” recipe dates from 01926 or [a thousand years
earlier][9], or all the way back to [Nagarjuna 1700 years
earlier][10], to whom rasāyana (रसायन) and rasaśāstra are
traditionally attributed.  (On p. 20 he claims that a particular
prescription, one [tola][11] of purified sulfur mixed with butter,
“was prescribed more than 5000 years ago.  Present-day human beings
can stand only one fourth to half of the dose prescribed in those
days.”  units(1) and Wikipedia agree that a tola is an 80th of a seer,
(though Dr. Mookerji says it's a 64th of a seer) and a seer is 14400
grains by the British Colonial Standard, so a tola is some 11.7 g if
the standards haven’t shifted too much in 5000 years; [elemental
sulfur’s oral LD₅₀ is unknown but is over 5000 mg/kg][12], so if
Dr. Mookerji was getting toxic symptoms from feeding a “beautiful
lady” 11.7 g of sulfur (<300 mg/kg) every day for three weeks, maybe
his sulfur was contaminated, probably with arsenic.)

[12]: http://extoxnet.orst.edu/pips/sulfur.htm

On p. 301 (345/406) Dr. Mookerji gives the chain of weights java
(barley seed)x6 = gunja; ×3 = balla; ×2 = masha; ×2 = dharana; ×2 =
niska; ×2 = kola; ×2 = tola.  This would make the tola 1152 barley
seeds.  Normally a barley seed is about 40 mg, which would make the
tola some 46 g rather than 12 g, but perhaps Indian barley was smaller
a thousand years ago.  He also says a java weighs 6 mustard seeds
(sarshapas), and mustard seeds are typically about 3–6 mg, which would
put a java at 18–36 mg, unless modern mustard seeds are similarly
enlarged.

Still, though, I think Dr. Mookerji’s explanation of how to make a
phallus out of mercury or “rasalingam” (Vol. 1, p. 10, 45/406) by
dissolving one third of its weight of gold leaf into it, then rubbing
it with vegetable sour juice, putting it inside a lemon, and boiling
it in gruel, is much more convincing than [Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev’s
explanation that consecration or energization with a divine
reverberation is what solidifies the 99.2%-pure mercury][11] [or
99.8%-pure mercury][12] in the mercury lingas in the temple he
consecrated called Dhyanalinga, in the subterranean water tank called
Theerthakund.

He explains that the term “pārada” comes from “para”, “end”, and “da”,
“give”, both of which words amusingly enough have the same meaning in
Spanish, and in the case of “da” is in fact the same word.  Spanish
“parar” “stop” comes from Latin “parāre” “prepare” or “make ready”,
which comes from Proto-Indo-European “\*pere-” “produce, procure”,
which I think very likely isn't the same as Sanskrit “end”.

Getting back to the refractory recipe, [Sigma says tribasic calcium
phosphate melts at 1100°][2], which doesn’t count as “a strong fire
proof” in my book, but it’s already hot enough for a pretty wide range
of uses; and the carbon would tend to support it up to much higher
temperatures.  [WP says tribasic calcium phosphate Ca₃(PO₄)₂ melts at
1670°][3] so maybe Sigma was talking about hydroxyapatite Ca₅(PO₄)₃OH;
WP says, “Most commercial samples of ‘tricalcium phosphate’ are in
fact hydroxyapatite.”

[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricalcium_phosphate

I think this phosphate-formation reaction probably has the
stoichiometry to actually work.  [Human milk has about a 1.4:1 to
1.7:1 Ca:P ratio, while cow’s milk is 1.24:1][4], while TCP is (by
moles) 1.5:1 and hydroxyapatite is 1.67:1, so if you wanted to make
calcium phosphate cement out of cow’s milk, you’d have to add about
0.25–0.5 moles of calcium for each mole of phosphate in the milk.
[Buffalo’s milk is reported to have higher calcium, except in
Argentina][5]:

> Buffalo milk is characterized by high calcium content (about
> 1.5-fold Ca than in cow’s milk) as was apparent from several
> studies, except in BM from Argentina (Patino et al. 2007) which had
> Ca content comparable to that of CM.

And buffalo-milk phosphate content seems to be similar to that of
cow’s milk.  So it’s possible that buffalo milk wouldn’t be
calcium-deficient in the same way — but I really have no idea whether
we’re talking about Indian buffalo from 01926, 01826, 01626, 01226,
00426, or what, so no way to even guess at the calcium content of
their milk.

Alternative routes to heat-setting castable refractory mortars
--------------------------------------------------------------

Even if cow’s milk doesn’t work, though, different sources of
phosphate and calcium (or possibly aluminum or boron) would surely
work to form calcium phosphate (or aluminum phosphate or boron
phosphate) at high temperatures.

The 01950 MIT dissertation of Wm. David Kingery (“the father of modern
ceramics”), [“Phosphate Bonding in Refractories”][58] seems very much
worth reading here.  He outlines a wide variety of recipes then in use
or disclosed in patents, and in particular mentions:

> Aluminum, chromium, magnesium, and zirconium oxides react chemically
> with phosphoric acid at 200°C to form a bonded material.  The metal
> phosphate reaction products are refractory and stable.  Rather than
> using the oxides, the halides of magnesium, tin, thorium, calcium,
> barium, aluminum, zirconium, or titanium may be used with phosphoric
> acid to form a bonded refractory.  After mixing the constituents to
> a pasty constituency, the plastic mass is formed and heated to
> approximately 1000°C to effect the bonding reactions and form the
> final product.  Using aluminous refractory materials, phosphoric
> acid reacts to form a film of aluminum phosphate around each
> particle, which acts as a bond. ... 
> 
> Aluminum hydrate [i.e., hydroxide] may be used with refractory clay,
> filler and phosphoric acid to form a bond which becomes permanent
> when heated to 100–300°C.  The addition of aluminum hydrate to
> refractory compositions of zircon, silicon, etc., and phosphoric
> acid is also advantageous.  Use of this material allows final heat
> hardening at temperatures of about 600°F [i.e., 315°] rather than
> the 1200°F [i.e., 650°] which must otherwise be applied. ...
> 
> With aluminous materials, alkaline earth acid phosphates or ammonium
> acid phosphates may be used in place of phosphoric acid.  On heating
> to 200–300°C bonding action is obtained...
>
> Acid phosphates may also be formed by addition of triphosphate
> [i.e., tribasic phosphate] and an acid which readily reacts with it
> forming mono- or bi-phosphates [i.e., hydrogen or dihydrogen
> phosphates].  This process may be used with alkaline earth
> phosphates, preferably calcium which is less expensive than other
> materials. ...

[58]: https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/10129471.pdf 

And that’s exactly what I speculated above is going on with the
buffalo milk: it contains some amount of calcium phosphates which are
not yet tribasic.  Also, though, this sort of points out that the
acids formed by burning the protein in the milk might help to acidify
the phosphates further, perhaps replacing some of its hydroxyls with
hydrogens.  He also mentions a very exciting possibility of refractory
inorganic elastomers:

> A study of the use of metaphosphates in refractory mortars by Herold
> and Bust indicated that *rubber-like metaphosphate polymers* form a
> clay-gel cement with clay.  However, a large amount of the phosphate
> was required to form an adequately plastic mass.

He goes on to mention some other possibilities:

> In all, the oxides and/or hydrates of thirty-four cations were
> tested.  ...Oxides of a highly basic nature react so violently with
> phosphoric acid that a porous friable structure results (MgO, ZnO,
> CaO, La₂O₃, BaO, SrO). ...
> 
> A large number of weakly basic and amphoteric oxides did react with
> phosphoric acid to produce a bonded cement-like product.  Included
> in this group are BeO, CuO, Cu₂O, CdO, Fe₂O₃, Fe₃O₄, SnO, Pb₃O₄,
> Al(OH)₃, Ti(OH)₄, Zn(OH)₄, ThO₂ and V₂O₅ in addition to calcined
> ZnO, MgO, La₂O₃ and CaO [with partially neutralized acid].

This suggests that the iron oxide of Dr. Mookerji’s recipe might *not*
be an inert filler as I thought.

On p. 17 (23/94) of his dissertation he has a chart of “modulus of
rupture” (flexural strength, the same as the tensile strength for a
homogeneous material) of an alumina mix with 10% kaolin bonded with
various amounts of various phosphate cement mixes; aluminum is best at
some 1300 psi (9 MPa), followed by beryllium (1200 psi, 8 MPa),
magnesium (almost the same), and, surprisingly, iron (1100 psi,
8 MPa).  Just bonding the mix with phosphoric acid alone yielded 750
psi, same as with barium, while calcium and thorium did substantially
worse (as he puts it, “Calcium, barium, and thorium additions to
phosphoric acid decrease its effectiveness [as a cement for alumina
and kaolin].”).  Moreover, all the good performers showed strength
continuing to grow linearly with the cement fraction — he only tried
up to 7% or 8% cement by weight, and while the weaker bonds like Ca
and Ba were leveling off at that point, the stronger bonds weren’t,
suggesting this was only a small fraction of the strength they could
potentially develop.

Later on (p. 33, Fig. 9) he measures a strength of 2500 psi (17 MPa)
with 13% monoaluminum phosphate (Al(H₂PO₄)₃) cement.  He makes the
monoaluminum phosphate sound super tempting: it gradually increases in
viscosity as the water content decreases, and then you can fire it to
a berlinite gel, much like waterglass.  But these solutions
“precipitate at pH values greater than about 2.8” (p. 34), so maybe
you can do the same kind of instant hardening trick you can do with
waterglass, only with bases rather than acids.

Another interesting thing he points out, when he tried mixing up some
different phosphate mortars, is that at 1500° the magnesium phosphate
mortar is stronger than the aluminum phosphate mortar, because the
aluminum phosphate mortar hasn’t started fusing yet!

Ultimately, he says, the monoaluminum phosphate ends up as aluminum
metaphosphate, Al(PO₃)₃ (p. 25), which is different from the AlPO₄
orthophosphate of which berlinite consists.  But [above 830°, in the
absence of oxygen, as in a gasworks, the metaphosphate gradually
becomes the orthophosphate!][58] And above 1220°, again in the absence
of oxygen, even that berlinite gradually calcines to sapphire.  This
all happens in a few hours when it’s in a very thin layer.

In isolation the phosphates that dissociate sometimes produce
phosphoric acid, and sometimes pyrophosphates or polyphosphates.  A
“metaphosphate” is a polyphosphate chain that’s either cyclic (as in
the trimetaphosphate and hexametaphosphate of sodium, rings of
respectively three and six phosphate radicals) or extremely long.

Phosphates, ordered by the decomposition or melting point of their
crystalline structure as a rough guide to how stable it is:

- [Magnesium ammonium phosphate][23], Mohs 1.5–2, mineral struvite
- [Diammonium phosphate][8], decomposes at 155°
- [Nickel phosphate][30], decomposes at 158°
- [Monosodium phosphate][14], decomposes at 169° to disodium
  pyrophosphate or to sodium trimetaphosphate at 500° over 5 hours
- [Ferric phosphate][9], decomposes at 250°
- [Monopotassium phosphate][17], melts at 252°, decomposes at 400°
- [Cupric phosphate][10], Mohs 4–6, decomposes somewhere over 300°
- [Monopotassium phosphate][12], decomposes to potassium metaphosphate
  KPO₃ at 400°
- [Dipotassium phosphate][11], decomposes at 465°
- [Disodium pyrophosphate][15], melts over 600°
- [Sodium tripolyphosphate][21], melts at 622°, very water-soluble
- [Sodium trimetaphosphate][18], melts at 627.6° (?), can be
  synthesized from [orthophosphoric acid and table salt at 600° in 2
  hours][19]
- [Sodium hexametaphosphate][13], melts at 628° but hydrolyzes
  spontaneously
- [Zinc phosphate][25], melts at 900°, common corrosion inhibitor,
  dental cement
- [Cobalt phosphate][29], melts at 1160°
- [Trimagnesium (di)phosphate][24], melts at 1184°
- [Tripotassium phosphate][16], melts at 1380°, strongly basic like
  TSP, deliquescent
- [Boron phosphate][22], sublimes at 1450°, glassy but crystallizable
  reaction product of boric acid and phosphoric acid, or at 1000° of
  diammonium phosphate and borax
- [Trisodium phosphate][20], melts at 1583°, strongly basic and
  water-soluble
- And of course [aluminum phosphate][26], melts at 1800°

So much for phosphates; what about the cations — boron, calcium,
magnesium, and aluminum?

Boron is the simplest, and [borates (not to be confused with Borat)
have also been used to make ordinary methyl vinyl silicone into a
“ceramizable composite”][35].  It has the advantage of having a very
amphoteric oxide, so you can get your boron as a borate.  Indeed,
nearly all the non-borate compounds of boron are extremely exotic,
highly toxic, very unstable, or all three.

It’s worth mentioning that, if I’m remembering correctly, borates are
commonly used to *slow down* the setting of magnesium phosphate
cements.

- [Borazane][34], melts at 104°.  Just kidding.
- [Boric acid][27], melts at 170.9°, water-soluble; tends to evaporate
  rapidly over 500°.
- [Ammonium pentaborate][31], decomposes over the range 428.3°–458.4°
  after several dehydration steps, water-soluble; this also makes the
  stuff one of the highest-temperature ammonium compounds ([a 01994 paper says
- [Cesium dodecaborate][33].  Just kidding.
- [Borax][28], melts at 743° when anhydrous, but the more normal
  decahydrate melts at 75°; water-soluble.
- [Zinc borate][32], melts at 980°.
- Calcium borates in the 986°–1479° range; see below.

Calcium of course has many compounds, but most of them are dismayingly
stable for this sort of purpose, like [larnite][38] (melts at 2130°)
and [quicklime][39] (melts at 2613°), though Kingery’s experiments
quoted above suggest that quicklime reacts with phosphoric acid with
great violence even at room temperature.  Less heat-stable compounds
include:

- [Chloride of lime][46], which melts at 100° and decomposes at 175°,
  is a strong oxidizer, is highly water-soluble, and gradually
  decomposes to quicklime in air.
- [Oxalate of lime][49], which decomposes at 200°.
- [Calcium formate][37], which decomposes at 300° to chalk and
  formaldehyde.
- [Calcium nitrate][45], which decomposes starting at 500°.
- [Chalk][36], which of course calcines (thus the name) to quicklime
  at temperatures over 550°, and rapidly over 898°.
- [Slaked lime][44], which calcines to quicklime at 580°.
- [Calcium sulfite][43], melts at 600°, oxidizes in air to alabaster;
  used in food as a sparingly soluble oxygen-scavenger antioxidant.
- [Muriate of lime][47], melts at 775°, deliquescent at room
  temperature.
- [Calcium tetraborate][42], melts at 986°, CaB₄O₇, tends to be
  glassy, but can be devitrified in a few minutes — but there are
  several calcium borates, many of which can be understood as
  [continuously varying mixtures of boria B₂O₃ and quicklime CaO][41],
  with melting points varying from 986° to 1479° (or 2613° if you
  count quicklime itself).
- [Calcium metaborate][40], melts at 1154° apparently, Ca(BO₂)₂

How about magnesium?  [Magnesium phosphate is an awesome refractory
cement][57].  As with calcium, [the oxide] is absurdly stable, melting
at 2852°, though it’s quite soft.  But there are some convenient
magnesium compounds that could provide magnesium to react with
phosphate if heated:

- [Magnesium nitrate][55] melts at 129° and decomposes at 330°.  It’s
  very water-soluble.
- [Magnesium formate][51] decomposes to magnesium carbonate around
  200° and magnesia around 400°.
- [Magnesium carbonate][52] decomposes to magnesia around 350°–900°.
- [Magnesium oxalate][54] decomposes to magnesia around 420°–620°.
- [Magnesium chloride][48] melts at 714°.  It’s very water-soluble.
- [Magnesium sulfite][56] melts at 1124° (?).
- There exist magnesium borates too, including "admontite",
  "mcallisterite", and "boracite", with uses including microwave
  dielectrics (?), and apparently they melt over 1000°.  Often these
  are produced by reacting magnesia with boric acid at low
  temperatures.  However, it is remarkably hard to find good
  information about their physical properties, such as their melting
  point, hardness, and strength.

If anything, most aluminum compounds are even more obnoxiously stable
than those of calcium and magnesium, but there are exceptions.  The
obvious candidate sources for aluminum cations are aluminum
trihydroxide and metallic aluminum; also, the highly water-soluble
(and violently acidic) aluminum chloride sublimes at 180°.

(Aluminum hydroxide flour might also be an interesting material for an
Oogoo made with hardware-store silicone, as an alternative to
cornstarch; it might contribute strength, but also possibly contribute
hydroxyls to speed the uniform setting of the silicone, and then,
after setting, might make it possible to calcine the silicone into a
silicoaluminate or carborundum-alumina composite.)
