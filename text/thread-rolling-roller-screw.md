A roller screw can have its rollers either move with the shaft through
the middle, in which case only a short length of the shaft needs to be
threaded, but the entire outer tube needs to be threaded on the
inside; or it can have the rollers move with the nut, in which case
the rollers will attempt to engage a thread along the entire length of
the shaft.

Itâ€™s possible to arrange for the advance of the roller screw to be
arbitrarily small in a differential fashion, potentially a tiny
fraction of the thread pitch per rotation.  This suggests that, by
using tapered, hardened rollers, it should be possible to use a roller
screw to roll a thread onto a previously unthreaded shaft, with an
extremely manageable low torque, much like a hand thread-cutting die,
but rolling a thread on the shaft rather than cutting one.  The
threads on the nut would be tapered to compensate.

By a similar principle, it should be possible to roll threads onto the
inside of a hole by using a tapered shaft with tapered thread rollers
rolling around it.
