You ought to be able to use yttria-stabilized zirconia, magnesia,
carborundum, or graphite as a cathode for electrochemical machining of
metals in a molten-salt electrolyte.  I think zirconia needs to be
heated up to 500 degrees, maybe 800 degrees, before it becomes
conductive, but carborundum and graphite do not.

[Magnesia was what Nernst used in his original lamp, with a platinum
preheating filament][0], but it is fragile and presumably requires
even higher temperatures to become conductive than zirconia; [the
temperature for magnesia was originally claimed to be over 3000°][1],
though [magnesia melts at only 2852°][2].  [Hartman solved the mystery
in 01906][4], finding temperatures from 1780°-2360°, but these were
the temperatures at which the globars were operated to provide light,
not the lowest temperatures required to make them conductive.

The commercially sold Nernst lamps used platinum filaments heated to
redness to preheat the “glowers”, which were presumably already
zirconia rather than magnesia, though [the 01903 manual doesn’t
say][3], only that they are “porcelain-like”.  Hartman said the
glowers he tested in 01906 were magnesia.  [Mills’s history of the
lamp][5] said magnesia required “above a red heat”, and explained that
it required a ballast resistor to stabilize it because of its negative
temperature coefficient of resistance.  Nernst used a red-hot iron
wire in a hydrogen envelope for this resistor.

Mills also mentions that early carborundum was insufficiently
conductive for use as globars.

Another promising oxide for this sort of thing is [bismuth
trioxide][6], which is significantly conductive down to room
temperature.  The monoclinic room-temperature form is four orders of
magnitude less conductive than the delta form that’s favored above
727°; analogous to YSZ, doping with other metal oxides can stabilize
these more conductive forms to lower temperatures.  However, its
melting point is only 817°, so while it might be useful for
molten-salt electrochemistry, it wouldn’t work well as a globar.
(It’s also nontoxic, insoluble in water (though attacked by CO2 unless
stabilized with silicate), and has an astounding density of 8.9 g/cc;
[sillenite, a bismuth silicate][7], is even denser at 9.2 g/cc, and
though very soft, it might be an interesting aggregate to add to
pottery to increase its density.)

ECM at the higher temperatures enabled by molten salts ought to permit
faster material removal than in aqueous solutions, and might be
particularly appealing for metals that are difficult to machine
electrochemically in aqueous solutions; however, I think only gold and
some of the platinum-group metals really suffer from this.
