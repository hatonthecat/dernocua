Because it’s the most common masculine singular nominative suffix,
Greek is full of nouns and adjectives that end in “-os” (“-ος”),
including many people’s names, although in many cases English got them
by way of Latin, which usually substituted its own masculine singular
nominative suffix, “-us”.  And there’s also an “-ιος” suffix (I think
that’s the singular genitive of the same declension?) which gives us
names like “Apollonios” and “Dionysios” and Hephaestus's epithet
“Aitnaios”, as well as highly productive suffixes like “-ασσος”, for
places, and “-ισμος”, for procedures or beliefs.  Of course, to a
programmer, the “-os” suffix sounds like an operating system, like
MacOS, AmigaOS, MS-DOS, RISC OS, iOS, IOS, BeOS, GEOS, GECOS, SunOS,
Unicos, ReactOS, FreeDOS, TempleOS, KeyKOS, Palm OS, ChibiOS, and the
like, and there is a long tradition of naming computer systems after
figures from Greek mythology, such as Kerberos and Project Athena.

So multilingual puns seem to be called for.

This is not an entirely new idea; [CDC named an OS “Kronos”][0],
[there was an MS-DOS alternative called “THEOS”][1], of course EROS,
and there has probably been more than one OS called [Cosmos][10],
[DEMOS/ДЕМОС][30], and at least three named Minos.

Adding to the potential for multilingual puns, masculine *plurals* of
nouns and adjectives in Spanish and Portuguese *also* commonly end in
“-os”, and “Unicos” and “AROS” are already Spanish (and Portuguese)
words, meaning “only” and “rings/earrings” respectively; [Liddell and
Scott additionally define ἄρος][2] as “use, profit, help”.  Too bad
it’s already taken!

But we could imagine, for example, the cult of HefaistOS AitnaiOS in
LemnOS, OdysseOS, DionysOS and his thiasOS and SeilenOS drinking from
a cantharOS, carrying a thyrsOS (with which fire was stolen) and
suffering a sparagmOS, hermaphroditOS, FalOS, OceanOS, TyrnavOS,

or TyphoiOS][13], AischylOS, [PatroclOS][14], [FaidrOS][15],
[OrthOS][16] (which is “assholes” in Spanish, though misspelled),
[KadmOS][17], [AigyptOS][18], NarkissOS, IkarOS, [TalOS][21] the gift
of HefaistOS KholOS to MinOS, [KokalOS][22] who gave DaidalOS refuge
in KamikOS from MinOS, PegasOS, OrfeOS, AisculapiOS, MinotaurOS,
[CetOS][23], [AgriOS][24], EnkeladOS, [HippolytOS][25], SisyphOS,
NessOS the son of KentaurOS who slew Herakles the lover of IolaOS and
slayer of AntaiOS, [AkhaiOS][26], [NostOS][29], LykourgOS the
law-giver, LesbOS, BarbarOS (which in colloquial Argentine Spanish
meaning “excellent”), DemosiOS (“public”, of the δημος), HeraklitOS,
[OstrakismOS][33], [ByblOS][34], [PapyrOS][35], [BybliOS][36], DiOS
(“of Zeus”), and so on.

Several other promising names turn out to not end in “-ος” in Greek:
Prometheus and Theseus, for example.

Really, though, you can probably find a Greek name ending in “-ος” for
any concept you care to name an OS after.
