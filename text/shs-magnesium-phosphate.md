According to doi:10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00463, one of the difficulties
with magnesium cements using phosphoric acid is:

> These reactions are highly, often violently, exothermic, which
> raises practical challenges regarding the use of this process on a
> large scale.

Specifically they’re talking about MgO + 2H₃PO₄ + H₂O →
Mg(H₂PO₄)₂·2H₂O, which is soluble, and MgO + H₃PO₄ + 2H₂O →
MgHPO₄·3H₂O, which is not.

“Highly, often violently, exothermic” sounds great for
self-propagating high-temperature synthesis, and both MgO and H₃PO₄
are solid at ordinary temperatures.  But where do you get the water?

Aside from preparing the mix well below 0°, a possible alternative is
to use a hygroscopic magnesium salt rather than the oxide.  Magnesium
chloride is annoyingly hygroscopic, as I’ve been experiencing today
(normally a hexahydrate), and Epsom salt (normally a heptahydrate)
actually has an *undecahydrate*, Fritzsche’s salt, which melts at 2°.
So even a little bit of the hygroscopic salt might be adequate.
Magnesium nitrate is so hygroscopic it can’t even be dehydrated by
heating.  The bromide is outright deliquescent.

Another possibility is the oxalate, which is normally a dihydrate and
decomposes to the oxide on heating.

So, for example, maybe you could use 5MgO + 2(MgSO₄·7H₂O) + H₃PO₄.

A different way to use this rapid cementation reaction might be to
spray aqueous phosphoric acid (or dissolved phosphates of ammonia)
onto a powder bed containing an MgO or Mg(OH)₂ binder, and a filler
such as quartz, in order to 3-D print.  The paper also mentions
rapid-setting magnesium phosphate cements:

However, these form the wimpy struvite rather than phosphates of just
magnesium.

It also mentions that sodium dihydrogenphosphate (monosodium
phosphate) is twice as soluble as the ammonium salt (MAP), which is
57% more soluble than the potassium salt.

The magnesium salts that are easy to find here are the citrate, the
carbonate (gym chalk), the chloride, and the sulfate, which (being
fertilizer) is cheapest: US$1/kg, oddly cheaper than even dolomite.
The oxide *is* available but only in an expensive food-grade form.
The nitrate is also available as fertilizer, but costs much more than
the sulfate.
