Because polyvinyl alcohol can be (ionically) crosslinked with borate
to gel, forming a much less water-soluble polymer (though still a
thermoplastic), I think you could do a useful 3-D printing system by
extruding a solution of polyvinyl alcohol in water, either spraying
the surface with a solution of borax or boric acid in between layers
to solidify it, or submerging it into a tank of the same.

The polymer is already widely available, sold as a mold release, for
about US$50/kg, and is biodegradable and non-toxic.  (Borate is also
pretty nontoxic, but it’s not in the same league as PVA.)  It’s quite
strong and stiff, comparable to PLA.

This system would have the following potential advantages over the
now-conventional PLA FDM process developed by the RepRap project:

- No heating is needed for the extruder.
- The polymer is crystal-clear, enabling the production of transparent
  objects; films of it are commonly used in optical devices.
- The hydrogel resulting from adding the borate is elastomeric and
  sufficiently hygroscopic to resist dehydration under ordinary
  conditions.
- Various functional fillers can easily be added.  I have some PVA
  glue here that’s full of glitter.
- When dry, it has extremely low oxygen permeability for an organic
  material.
- Because the polymer is mixed with a solvent, it can form a lower
  volume fraction of the final product; I think loadings under 10% are
  common in school glue.  This should permit higher *filler* loadings
  in the final product than in filled PLA systems, which may permit
  better filler-induced properties, such as mechanical strength,
  stiffness, magnetism, conductivity, porosity, glitteriness, etc.

Alternatively, you could use it for a liquid-vat-hardening process
similar to SLA, in which the liquid is selectively hardened not by
selective exposure to light but by selective deposition of borate on
the surface of a vat of liquid, using one or many nozzles, alternating
with raising the level of liquid in the vat slightly.  With the right
crosslinking initiators, you could probably induce PVA to crosslink
with light, too, which would probably form a covalently linked
thermoset rather than the ionically crosslinked thermoplastic formed
by the PVA/borate system.

There exist alternative crosslinkers for PVA that produce higher
strength without UV, such as glutaraldehyde, which creates a
covalently crosslinked material.
