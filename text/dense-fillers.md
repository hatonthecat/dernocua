Making things feel heavy is cool because people feel like light things
are cheap and worthless.  But there are cheap high-density fillers.

One of the very cheap things Ecoquimica sells (see file
`material-observations.md`) is baryte.  I was thinking I didn’t have
any use for that, but it occurs to me that it might be useful as a
high-density filler, with density theoretically
4.48 g/cc.  And at Mohs 3–3.5 it should be easy to mill to finer
granulometry.  Baryte-filled silicone might be 3.4 g/cc and ought to
be a bright, pure white, and much less resonant than pure or
quartz-filled silicone.  I see it’s also used for X-ray shielding, for
making the first synthetic phosphor, *Lapis Boloniensis* (through
carbothermal reduction to the anomalously water-soluble barium
sulfide, which doesn’t melt until 2235°), and as a metal-casting mold
release (melts at 1580°, decomposes at 1600°), as well as a source of
barium for other materials like the remarkable and dangerous BaO₂.
I’m wary of using it in reactions, though, because of barium
heavy-metal toxicity.

For just adding weight and whiteness to things, zinc oxide (5.6 g/cc)
might be superior, and is also interesting for oxychloride and
phosphate uses, but from Ecoquimica it costs AR$5200/kg (US$29/kg) to
baryte’s AR$83/kg (46¢/kg).  Other vendors [have it for lower prices
like AR$1500/kg][6] but nothing in the neighborhood of baryte.  And if
you *just* want density, you can get scrap lead, copper, and steel
pretty cheap; a [30kg lead ingot][7] is AR$13500 (AR$450/kg,
US$75/30kg, US$2.50/kg), and I’m pretty sure the scrap metal guy
around the corner pays something like AR$950/kg for copper, AR$700/kg
for brass, and AR$100/kg for lead, all of which are more expensive
than baryta (but denser).  Steel is too cheap for him to even deal
with.

For building machine tool frames, baryta’s vibration-damping and
density properties might be highly desirable.

As a small dog nipped at my heels in the street, it occurred to me
that maybe magnetite might be denser than zinc oxide and also cheaper,
but [as it turns out magnetite is only 5.17 g/cc][6], slightly less
dense than zinc oxide.  Related fillers that really *are* higher
density include black cupric oxide (79.545 g/mol, 6.315 g/cc, boils at
2000°, -156 kJ/mol) and the safer but less air-stable red cuprous
oxide (143.09 g/mol, 6.0 g/cc, boils at 1800°, -170 kJ/mol), both of
which contain one oxygen and some copper (63.546 g/mol, 8.96 g/cc,
boils at 2562°).

Also, any of those four oxides could serve as an oxidizer for
self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (cf. file
`shs-magnesium-phosphate.md`); magnetite is 231.533 g/mol and
[-1120.89 kJ/mol][7] (-280.223 kJ/mol O₁) and commonly used; zinc
oxide is 81.406 g/mol, 5.606 g/cc, and a very tame -350.5 kJ/mol, and
while it boils at 1974°, zinc metal boils at only 907°, which is why
welding on galvanized metal is dangerous.  In theory I ought to be
able to make black cupric oxide from recycled copper for AR$900/kg ×
63.546/79.545 ≈ AR$700/kg; copper dihydroxide (97.561 g/mol,
3.368 g/cc, -450 kJ/mol) dehydrates into cupric oxide at 80°.

On 02021-08-24 I walked by the neighborhood recycler (“COMPRO METALES,
X MAYOR Y MENOR, Pago Mas!...”) to check on scrap prices.  He’s
offering AR$600/kg for brass and bronze (US$3.3/kg), AR$100/kg for
aluminum (56¢/kg), AR$170/kg for lead (95¢/kg), and AR$900/kg for
batteries (US$5.0/kg), which it turns out refers to lead-acid
batteries, not disposable alkaline batteries (mostly manganese dioxide
and zinc) — the 95¢/kg is the price for other lead, I guess things
like tire weights, while the factory buys back the dead batteries for
more than US$5/kg, presumably because of the high-purity lead content.
He’s not buying copper at all today, it looks like; I wonder if that
means he has scrap copper he can’t sell?

I've made copper hydroxide in the past by electrolysis, mixed,
probably, with cupric chloride and the acetate, both of which are
water-soluble, which should make separation easy.  (Cuprous chloride
is less water-soluble, but its K<sub>sp</sp> is still 1.72 × 10⁻⁷, 13
orders of magnitude more than cupric hydroxide’s 2.20 × 10⁻²⁰, and at
any rate it’s difficult to make.)  If my objective were to make a lot
of pure cupric oxide, I could use a plain vinegar electrolyte or a
sulfate electrolyte to eliminate the chlorides.  I bet Mina would
appreciate the pigment, too.

So the points on the Pareto tradeoff curve for density to cost are
something like:

- Osmium: [US$13000/kg][8], 22.65 g/cc, or possibly iridium at more
  than twice that price
- Tungsten: [US$30/kg][9], 19.3 g/cc
- Lead scrap: 95¢/kg, 11.34 g/cc
- Steel scrap: [21¢/kg][10], 7.9 g/cc
- Magnetite: [10¢/kg][11] [or so][12], 5.17 g/cc
- Quartz (as construction sand): 3¢/kg, 2.648 g/cc

More briefly:

22.65 g/cc Os (US$13000/kg), 19.3 g/cc W (US$30/kg), 11.34 g/cc Pb
(95c/kg), 7.9 g/cc Fe (21c/kg), 5.17 g/cc Fe3O4 (10c/kg), 2.648 g/cc
SiO2 (3c/kg)

Mercury, litharge, minium, cinnabar, and tungsten carbide should
probably be on the curve, too.

Not making the curve but still pretty cool, in part because of their
colors:

- Baryte: 46¢/kg, 4.48 g/cc
- Zinc oxide: US$29/kg, 5.6 g/cc
- Cupric oxide: US$3.90/kg, 6.315 g/cc
- Manganese dioxide: 5.026 g/cc

I visited the recycler and bought a kg of copper wire from him, which
cost AR$1200 (US$6.70/kg).  He explained that lead-acid battery lead
“is a different alloy” which is a reason for the higher price, also
indicating the plastic case as another reason, but I think he sort of
has those both backwards.  Still, as a heavy filler, scrap lead with
other impurities is probably close to the same density as pure battery
lead.
