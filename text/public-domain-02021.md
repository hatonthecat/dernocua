Writing file `reuleaux-constructor.md` I learned that the [01924 Sixth
Edition of the _Machinery’s Handbook_][0] has finally served its
sentence of copyright and graduated into the public domain.  It
occurred to me to check what else had recently thus graduated, in
[02021][1] and [02020][2].

[Evidently there was a 7-volume _Machinery’s Encyclopedia_][71], also
by Oberg and Jones, but unfortunately [only Volume 7 seems to be in
the Archive so far][72], and that one is scanned by Google, though it
was less ineptly carried out than the great mass of Google’s book
scans.  It is the “Index and Guide to Systematic Reading”.  Strangely,
the _Encyclopedia_, or at least that volume thereof, seems to be
devoid of illustrations.

Oberg died in 01951, but his coauthor [Franklin Day Jones][73] didn’t
die until 01967.  As I understand it, this means that, in countries
that sentence copyrighted works to life plus 70 years, and do not
observe the [rule of the shorter term][74], even the 01914 First
Edition of _Machinery’s Handbook_ will not be set free until 02037.
Argentina and the EU do observe the rule of the shorter term, for
example, but Germany does not.

Edgar Rice Burroughs’s _Tarzan_ and _Barsoom_ stories call attention;
though they were published since 01925, Burroughs has been dead since
01950, so in countries that limit copyright to life plus 70 years,
they are now fair game.  Similarly Shaw; Orwell’s _Animal Farm_ and
_1984_; Olaf Stapledon; Rex Ingram’s _The Prisoner of Zenda_, the
first Ruritanian fiction; all of Korzybski’s œuvre on General
Semantics; Edna St. Vincent Millay; and Schumpeter.  Gurdjieff died in
01949, and so did Margaret Mitchell (_Gone with the Wind_) and Richard
Strauss.

In countries that limit copyright to life plus 50 years, the work of
everyone who died in 01970 has now graduated into the public domain,
notably Carnap, Russell, E. M. Forster, Jimi Hendrix, Mishima, Nasser,
Rube Goldberg, and the _Death be not Proud_ of Gunther.  Adorno,
Eisenhower, Gropius, Kerouac, Meher Baba, and John Wyndham died in
01969.  Unfortunately of these only Nasser is actually *from* such a
country, so this doesn’t help those of us laboring under more
oppressive copyright regimes, even if they observe the rule of the
shorter term.  Taiwan, New Zealand, Thailand, Qatar, the UAE, Tunisia,
Bolivia, Iran, and the PRC are notable bright spots here, and Mexico
observes life + 50 for deaths before 01944-01-01, and Russia and
Switzerland, 01943-01-01.  India and Venezuela are currently life plus
60 years.

And [Tom Lehrer effectively released all his songs to the public
domain in 02020][3], [using his own website][4].

The rule of the shorter term has liberated all US works published up
to 01925 (and, less significantly, all works published up to 01925,
for users in the US); [in 02021, that gave us][5] _The Great Gatsby_,
Woolf’s _Mrs. Dalloway_, and Agatha Christie’s _The Secret of
Chimneys_, and [in 02020][6] Burroughs’s _Tarzan and the Ant Men_,
Agatha Christie’s _The Man in the Brown Suit_, _Doctor Dolittle’s
Circus_, Gershwin’s _Rhapsody in Blue_, and W.E.B. Du Bois’s _The Gift
of Black Folk_.  _The Boxcar Children_ was published in 01924, and
_The Velveteen Rabbit_ in 01922.  [Sinclair Lewis’s Babbitt][7] also
seems to be popular, and his _Main Street_ was published in 01920.
Not until 01926 would _The Sun Also Rises_ and _Winnie-the-Pooh_
appear (which last was published first in England), and we don’t get
_The Sound and the Fury_ or _A Farewell to Arms_ until 01929.

In nonfiction, [01925 gave us][8] Ronald A. Fisher’s [_Statistical
Methods for Research Workers_][9], in which frequentism was born;
Walter Lippmann’s [_The Phantom Public_][10], on Mussolini’s
manipulation of public opinion, proposing the agent/bystander
dichotomy; Napoleon Hill’s [_The Law of Success_][12], from which the
entire genre of soft-headed modern self-help books derives; [_The
Bolshevik Myth_][13], by anarchist Alexander Berkman, who committed
suicide in 01936, who was the lover Emma Goldman’s, who died in 01940,
written after he was deported to Russia, following Goldman’s _My
Disillusionment in Russia_ and _My Further Disillusionment in Russia_.
[01924 gave us][14] Haldane’s [_Daedalus_][15]; Crookshank’s virulent
pseudoscientific racist [_The Mongol in our Midst_][16]; and the
[_Lessons of October_][17] and _New Course_ by Trotsky, assassinated
01940.  [01923 gave us][21] Santayana’s epistemological [Scepticism
and Animal Faith][22], Henry Smith Williams’s ten-volume [Story of
Modern Science][24], the first two volumes of Churchill’s [World
Crisis][25], Bernays’s _Crystallizing Public Opinion_, and Jepson’s
[Manual of the Flowering Plants of California][23].

H.G. Wells was English, mostly published first in England, and died in
01946, so his works have mostly been in the public domain since 02016,
since [the UK sentences works to life + 70][18]; this notably includes
his 01919 [_Outline of History_][19], which rejects racism.  In 01924
Wells published _A Year of Prophesying_, a compilation of his
columns. _The Everlasting Man_, published in 01925, was by Chesterton,
who was also English, but who died in 01936; it is a rebuttal to
Wells’s _Outline_.

[The US doesn’t observe the rule of the shorter term][20] for works
published in 01926 to 01977 unless they were in the public domain in
their source country on 01996-01-01, so I think Wells’s post-01925
works are not yet free in the US, but Chesterton’s are.  (Churchill
and Eliot didn't die until 01965.)

Other public-domain works that catch my eye in the Archive:

* [_East of the Sun and West of the Moon_][27], 01922, published in
  New York, a book of folk tales I enjoyed as a kid
* [_History of the Cherokee Indians and their legends and folk
  lore_][28], published in Oklahoma, 01921
* [_The Babur-nama in English_][29], published in London, 01922,
  translated by Annette Susannah Beveridge, née Akroyd, who [died in
  01929][30]
* [_The Poetic Edda_][31], translated by Henry Adams Bellows (died
  01939), published in New York, 01923
* [_English Industries of the Middle Ages_][32], by [Louis Francis
  Salzman, died 01971][33], published at Oxford, 01923 (not public
  domain outside the US)
* [_The Joy of Cooking_][34], first published in the US in 01923 with
  unchanged reprintings up to 01957; Irma S. Rombauer died in 01962,
  but her daughter Marion Rombauer Becker didn’t die until 01976.  So
  the original editions are public domain in countries observing the
  rule of the shorter term, but not those that sentence foreign works
  to life + 70 years.
* [_Fuel and Refractory Materials_][35], poorly scanned in Bangalore,
  by Alexander Humboldt Sexton, published in Glasgow and Bombay in
  01921.  [Sexton seems to have been born in 01853][36] and [retired
  from the Chair of Metallurgy in 01909][37], so he almost surely died
  before 01950, but I have not found death records yet.
* [_A History of Magic and Experimental Science During the First
  Thirteen Centuries of Our Era, Volume I_][38], by Lynn Thorndike
  (died 01965), published 01923 by Columbia University Press (New York
  and London) and the Macmillan Company, describing the evolution of
  science from Roman times (Pliny, Seneca, and Ptolemy) up to the 13th
  century (Roger Bacon, Raymond Llull, Albertus Magnus).
* [_Among the Ibos of Nigeria_][39], published in London, 01921, by
  George Thomas Basden, died 01944, about the Igbo, covering marriage
  customs, slavery, religion, etc., with many high-resolution
  black-and-white photos.
* [_A course of pure mathematics_][40], by Godfrey Harold Hardy (died
  01947), Third Edition, published at Cambridge in 01921, a textbook
  of basic analysis (complex numbers, continuous functions,
  derivatives, integration, circular functions, exponentials, infinite
  series).
* [_Advanced laboratory practice in electricity and magnetism_][41],
  published in New York and London in 01922 by McGraw-Hill, by Earle
  Melvin Terry, died 01929.  Covers units, switches, rheostats,
  galvanometers, Ohm’s Law, Weston cells, Kelvin balances, ammeters,
  voltmeters, wattmeters, capacitance, resonance, electron-tube
  oscillators, alpha rays, beta rays, gamma rays, optical pyrometers,
  etc., with exercises.  Scanned in color at 400 dpi with numerous
  schematics and engravings.
* [_Servant of Sahibs_][42], excerpts from the travel diary of famed
  Ladakhi explorer [Ghulam Rassul Galwan][43] (died 01925), who [named
  the Galwan river][44], published in London in 01923.  This edition
  seems to be devoid of illustrations.
* [_Mazes and Labyrinths: a General Account of Their History and
  Developments_][45], by William Henry Matthews, who [died in
  01948][46], published in 01922 by Longmans, Green, & Co., in London,
  New York, Toronto, Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras., dedicated to his
  daughter Zeta (01914-02000), with 151 photos and other
  illustrations.  Though it focuses mostly on British mazes it also
  covers, for example, Pima and Mesa Verde mazes, and Troy.
* [_Welsh Fairy Tales_][47], by William Elliot Griffis ([died
  01928][48]), published in 01921 in New York by the Thomas Y. Crowell
  company.  A book of children’s stories.
* [_A Treatise on Probability_][49], by John Maynard Keynes,
  reprinting of 01921 first edition by Macmillan and Company.  I
  didn’t know Keynes had written a textbook on probability; on
  skimming, this seems to spend as much time on epistemology as on
  mathematical proofs.
* [_The Prophet_][50], published 01923 in the US, by Kahlil Gibran
  (died 01931), poorly scanned by Digital Library of India.
* [_Heraldry and Floral Forms as Used in Decoration_][51], published
  01922 in London, by English book illustrator [Herbert Cole][52],
  died 01930.  Abundant engravings scanned at 500 dpi.
* [_Sir Isaac Newton’s Daniel and the Apocalypse_][54], by [Sir
  William Whitla][53], died 01933, published 01922 in London, with the
  Latin translated into English.
* [_The Inscriptions of Asoka_][55], by Eugen Hultzsch, [died
  01927][56], published at Oxford 01925, with many black-and-white
  photos of the inscriptions, beautifully scanned at 300 dpi, along
  with transcriptions, transliterations, and translations.
* [_Leonhari Euleri, Opera Omnia (Opera Mathematica Volumen Septimum):
  Commentationes Algebraicae: Ad Theoriam Combinationum et
  Probabilitatum Pertinentes_][57], published by [Louis Gustave Du
  Pasquier, died 01957][58], published 01922, 644 pp., evidently
  mostly in French, with French notes by L. G. D., including
  manuscripts published here for the first time; though some Latin is
  present.  I’m not sure whether Euler’s French is Euler’s or a
  translation by L. G. D.  This is the 7th volume of the _Complete
  Works of Leonhard Euler_ (_Oeuvres complètes de Léonard Euler_).
  The scan is not very good because it’s by Akce-Universal Digital
  Library, but it’s not totally fucked up like their other scans.
  L. G. D. taught at the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland.  I’m
  not sure where this was published but I’m pretty sure it wasn’t the
  US, so it’s probably not in the public domain elsewhere.
* [_Selected stories from O. Henry_][59], died 01910, including _The
  Gift of the Magi_ (first published 01905), edited by his friend
  [C. Alphonso Smith][60], “late head of the Department of English at
  the United States Naval Academy”, died 01924, published by the
  Odyssey Press, New York, in 01922.
* [_The Story of Little Black Sambo_][61], by Helen Bannerman (died
  01946), published in New York in 01923 by the Frederick A. Stokes
  Company, following a London publication in 01899.  [Frequently
  criticized for racism][62], the story itself contains no racist
  stereotypes, but the illustrations do; [around World War II][63] the
  name Sambo became a byword for racism, though perhaps originally it
  derives from Foulah *sambo* “uncle” or Hausa *sambo* “second son”.
* [Lyman Churchill Newell’s 01922 extremely basic introductory
  textbook for children][64], with exercises; originally published by
  D. C. Heath & Co. (Boston, New York, Chicago), and he died in 01933.
  Scanned in color at 500 dpi, with 215 or so grayscale photographs
  and other figures.  The 560-page PDF is compressed very badly,
  inflicting fatal damage on most of the hundreds of photographs and
  other illustrations, but the original JP2 files are available and
  are not so corrupted.  Organic is relegated to “fuels and
  illuminants”, “other carbon compounds” and “food”, pp. 260-315,
  which I suppose in part represented the state of knowledge at the
  time.  Imperial units are used throughout except for temperature.
  “The topics suggested by the College Entrance Examination Board and
  the Board of Regents (New York) have been incorporated.”  The low
  information content of this book is hard to overstate; Gibbs free
  energy is not mentioned, and the notion of equilibrium is relegated
  to p. 152.
* [In Praise of Folly][65], by Desiderius Erasmus, in which he
  castigates royalty and the Church, published in New York by Peter
  Eckler Publishing Co. in 01922, with numerous engraved illustrations
  by Hans Holbein.  Peter Eckler himself wrote the preface, which is
  followed by a brief biography of Erasmus, who died in 01536.  The
  book seems to be printed entirely in English, but the biography and
  translation are uncredited.  Erasmus did presumably speak English,
  as he lived in England from 01510 to 01515, but [the first edition
  was published in Latin and Greek][66] ([mostly Latin][69]), with
  engravings by Holbein, who evidently died in 01543.  [Eckler had
  previously published Walt Whitman’s _Drum-Taps_ in 01865][67], and
  [_The Canon of the Bible_ in 01877][68], so he must have been very
  old by 01922!  My best guess is that Eckler was reprinting an
  earlier English translation, but not [John Wilson’s 01668
  translation][70], which is notably different and worse.
