ABEC-7 608 roller-skate bearings cost 20¢ in the US, 40¢ here in
Argentina, but are only rated for like 1-2 kN of static load.  [SKF
rates their deep-groove 608 bearings][0] at 1.37 kN static load.  So
what if you need more than twice that?

Well, you could support your shaft between three rollers at each end,
and support each of the six rollers on two bearings.  That ought to
give you twice the load capacity: 4×1.37 kN.  Also, it ought to give
you lower friction if the shaft is smaller than the rollers and the
rolling friction between the shaft and the rollers doesn’t itself
contribute an overwhelming amount of friction.

If that isn’t sufficient, you can repeat the process recursively, by
mounting a roller on your new shaft and making six such assemblies to
support another shaft, containing 36 rollers of the smaller size and
72 skate bearings.

This is silly, though, because at the point that you’re spending
US$15-30 on bearings, you might as well just buy a bigger bearing.
