Reading some random encyclopedia article, I came across a reference to
the dissociation energy of I₂ being (the photon energy of light of
wavelength) 578 nm, so that irradiating a mixture of H₂ and I₂ with
this light (kind of yellow-green apparently) accelerates the formation
of HI.

It occurred to me that monatomic halogens can react with a remarkably
large number of things, so doping a thin layer of something with I₂
might be a straightforward way to make it photosensitive, so that you
can pattern it with a yellow, green, blue, violet, or UV laser.  Where
the laser strikes, free iodine radicals are released, kicking off some
kind of polymerization or depolymerization or something.

Dunno, I guess iodine is not a very convenient element.
