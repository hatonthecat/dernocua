Sometimes a spark gap is used as a trigger for an exploding wire, but
it occurred to me that maybe you can do it the other way around: use
an exploding wire to trigger a spark gap.

If you mechanically put a thin wire *partway* across a near-breakdown
spark gap, you will get corona discharge around the end of the wire,
which will supply ions to seed the arc and tend to start forming a
streamer.  If that glow discharge turns into an arc, the wire will
start to heat up, and if it’s thin enough, it will explode into
plasma, completing the arc.

If the wire manages to bridge the spark gap completely instead of
partly, then it might develop a hot spot where it touches one or the
other electrode, which could melt it down to a round knob that’s too
round to create corona discharge and too close to the electrode for
avalanche to kick in (below the Paschen minimum).  Possibly a small
inductor in series with the wire (but only the wire, not the spark gap
itself) would avoid this danger.
