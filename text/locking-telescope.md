Looking at a telescoping antenna today it occurred to me that there
was a way to stabilize telescoping mechanisms for the purpose of, for
example, folding bicycles, with a bayonet-connector-like approach.

Specifically, given two coaxial tubes, one inside the other, you have
two or more pegs in one of them (say, the inner) which engage slots in
the other (say, the outer) when theyâ€™re close to the fully extended
position; by rotating the tubes relative to one another, the pegs move
into channels that move the tubes into a *really* fully extended
position, working against a spring, and when the rotation is
continued, the channel allows the pegs to slip into a detent, allowing
the spring to relax slightly.  The only difference from a BNC
connector is that the action is reversed: the pegs engage when the
tubes are nearly apart instead of nearly together, resisting
compression on the column formed by the two joined tubes instead of
tension.  (If you need to resist tension you can do that better with a
cable, which can be tensioned to hold the strut in compression.)

Optionally you can include a second analogous set of channels to lock
the tubes in the fully collapsed position as well, or any number of
other positions.

In this way a telescoping tube can provide a strong structural member
that can be easily collapsed for storage or transport.
