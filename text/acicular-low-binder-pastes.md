By using a platier or more acicular or fibrous granulated filler, you
can decrease the amount of binder needed, although at some point you
start having the stuff stick together without any binder at all.
Using smoother surfaces and larger particles also decreases the amount
of binder needed as well as the tendency to stick together without
binder.

This has implications for powder-bed 3-D printing: a small amount of
binder can bind a large amount of powder into a continuous solid
network, although the bound powder may be porous and weak.

Promising fillers that come to mind include talc, mica, milled clays
such as kaolin, acicular hydroxyapatite, asbestos, jade, graphite,
mullite, rockwool, glass fiber, carbon fiber, acicular wollastonite
(CaSiO3, the calcium analogue of enstatite, which has a totally
different crystal structure), ceramic fiber, steel fiber, acicular
boehmite (AlOOH, which more typically crystallizes in a massive
habit),
