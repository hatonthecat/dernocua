If you want to measure the shape of a metal surface, you can gently
touch it with a bunch of sharp springs, insulated from one another and
constantly separately tested for electrical continuity with the metal.
By moving this springy brush around, you can measure when each wire
enters and leaves contact with the surface; by only barely touching
the surface, you keep the stresses on the spring tips low enough to
avoid plastic deformation.  Using springs with a slight curve or coil
to them, rather than straight bristles, reduces the stress for a given
strain, protecting the tips from being blunted.

Itâ€™s important that the bristles not bend plastically or creep, so it
is advisable to make them out of a brittle substance with a high
melting point, such as tungsten, or such as aluminum oxide with thin
metal plating.  Sharp points can be achieved by growing crystals with
a naturally acicular habit, like mullite or some phosphates of
calcium, which will normally have atomically-sharp points which will
be blunted slightly by the metallic plating, or by electrolytic
sharpening of metallic points.
