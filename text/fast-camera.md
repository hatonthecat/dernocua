The [iPhone 6s specs](https://support.apple.com/kb/sp726?locale=en_US)
say it can record 720p video at 240 fps and 1080p video at 120 fps.  A
friend tells me he bought a replacement camera for US$8, including the
flex cable, but it was the front camera, which [is only 60fps for
720p](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50082391/what-are-the-fps-of-the-facetime-camera-for-the-iphone-6s-vs-7-vs-x-vs-ipad-pro).
