Talc (Mg₃Si₄O₁₀(OH)₂) is very interesting, particularly for cyclic
fabrication systems, because it [calcines to enstatite and amorphous
silica][a61] at 800–840°, and the enstatite (MgSiO₃) converts to
clinoenstatite at 1200° (?), and the amorphous silica to cristobalite
at 1300° [(or possibly it converts to enstatite above 1050°?)][a66];
enstatite [melts at some 1550°][a62] and quartz/cristobalite at 1713°.
You could think of enstatite as being a quartz/forsterite eutectic,
and indeed 1543° [is the lowest-melting point in the quartz/forsterite
continuum][a63], but the cristobalite crystals remain solid until
1713°.  (I’m not sure how solid the resulting slush is, though...)

Potential for inorganic cyclic fabrication systems
--------------------------------------------------

If you have an ample supply of talc, then, as with clay, you can shape
it into the geometry you want, and then fire it to harden it.  As with
clay, you can use tools thus made to shape new objects.  However,
firing talc to harden it does not (?) cause it to become plastic and
change in shape or shrink; the results are nonporous and extremely
unreactive; and they are capable of withstanding much higher
temperatures than those needed to fire them, so it should be easy to
make talc-firing ovens out of fired talc.  The required firing
temperature is lower than for most clays, and much lower than for
high-performance porcelain clays.

Because the unfired talc is not plastic and does not become plastic
during firing, very large shapes can be precisely cut and fired in a
gravitational field without suffering plastic deformation.  Though
brittle, the fired objects are highly resistant to thermal shock, in
part because of their low thermal coefficient of expansion
([enstatite’s linear TCE is a steel-like 11 ppm/K][a68]), permitting
their use for a wide variety of applications with demanding
temperature gradient requirements.

[a68]: https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.537.1305&rep=rep1&type=pdf "Thermal expansion of natural orthoenstatite to 1473 K, Eur. J. Mineral. 2003, 15, 469­473, Jackson et al."

Talc is a [useful feedstock for synthesizing cordierite][a69], a
common refractory with an acicular crystal habit and even lower TCE,
which can be as low as 0.8 ppm/K for porous cordierite materials.

[a69]: https://www.scientific.net/AMR.105-106.802 "Synthesis of Cordierite with Low Thermal Expansion Coefficient"

For machinery involving sliding contact, unfired talc serves as a dry
lubricant.

Obtaining adequate supplies of natural talc may be difficult, but
straightforward hydrothermal talc synthesis processes are known, and
some of them can be carried out in vessels made of fired talc.  The
[raw feedstocks are abundant][a70]: oxygen is 47% of the Earth’s
crust, silicon 28%, and magnesium 2.1%.  Only hydrogen is scarce
(0.14%), and it is removed in the firing process.

[a70]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth's_crust

Fired talc is hard enough to grind or cut softer metals, but I think
it can only barely cut steel, if that.

Even fired, talc is not a very good material for withstanding impact,
controlling electricity, or spring energy storage.

History of firing talc
----------------------

[An anonymous stone sculptor writes][a64] that they have been firing
soapstone as a stone-sculpting technique for many years:

> Many years ago I wrote an article about firing soapstone to make the
> stone harder. It is possible to harden the stone to the point that
> you cannot scratch it with anything short of steel. This will also
> close the structure of the stone enough to allow it to be used in
> outdoor applications. ... Insulators on the electric poles were at
> one time made of fired soapstone.

[a64]: https://nwssa.org/sculpture-northwest/the-stone-corner/111-stone-corner-firing-soapstone-marapr-2002 " Stone Corner - Firing Soapstone Mar/Apr 2002"

[A geology.com article says the Americans have been carving soapstone
for 8000 years][a65], although I’m not clear on whether the results
were fired — but because cooking bowls, cooking slabs, and smoking
pipes were among the uses, I suspect they were.  The same article
mentions the Scandinavian Bronze-Age use of soapstone for carving
bronze-casting molds.  (Also, it mentions that some “soapstone
carvings” are actually alabaster or serpentine.)

[a65]: https://geology.com/rocks/soapstone.shtml

Reportedly [potters use 50% talc, 50% ball clay][sc] for slipcasting.

Material qualities
------------------

In [“Synthesis of MgSiO₃ ceramics using natural desert sand as SiO2
source”][a71] Wang et al. mention some pretty cool benefits of
enstatite-based ceramics, including protoenstatite’s “adjustable
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), high strength, low dielectric
loss, and strong vibration resistance” at high temperatures, but
lament its tendency to crack when transforming to clinoenstatite at
lower temperatures.  Evidently this is not a problem with fired-talc
ceramics, though.

[a71]: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.084

Firing synthetic magnesium silicate
-----------------------------------

Apparently if you react soluble magnesium and silicate salts, at low enough Mg/Si ratios
[you get crystalline talc](https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/empa/islandora/object/empa%3A7119/datastream/PDF2/download/Nied-2016-Properties_of_magnesium_silicate_hydrates_%28M-S-H%29-%28accepted_version%29.pdf "Nied, D., Enemark-Rasmussen, K., L’Hopital, E., Skibsted, J., & Lothenbach, B. (2016). Properties of magnesium silicate hydrates (M-S-H). Cement and Concrete Research, 79, 323-332. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconres.2015.10.003 CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0")
but only above 200°.  But, according to the same paper, it looks like
amorphous synthetic magnesium silicate hydrates also produce silica
when fired in the same way, but at a slightly lower temperature:

> Differential thermal analysis (DTA) of the M-S-H samples reveals a
> distinct exothermic transition around 840 - 860 °C, which is
> attributed to the decomposition of amorphous M-S-H and the
> recrystallization to SiO₂ and enstatite (MgSiO₃) [11, 12] or SiO₂
> and forsterite (Mg₂SiO₄) for high Mg/Si ratios [29]. The
> dehydroxylation of the phyllosilicate sheets in talc
> (Mg₃Si₄O₁₀(OH)₂) and the transformation to SiO₂ and enstatite occurs
> at slightly higher temperatures of 850 to 950 °C [11, 12]. The lower
> dehydroxylation temperature of M-S-H compared to talc is consistent
> with a less crystalline structure [11, 12].

(It’s worth noting that their room-temperature synthesis took a year,
but only because they were using low-solubility feedstocks.)

And I’ve prepared what seems to be this amorphous material in my
kitchen by dumping magnesium chloride from the health food store into
a can of waterglass (see file `glass-foam.md` for details).  However,
it came out in the state of sort of slushy lumps; I’m not sure how to
stick it together into a more solid material.  Maybe with more
waterglass, I don’t know.
