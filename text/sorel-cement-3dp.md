[“Kiran K” of Larsen and Toubro reports that Sorel cement is sensitive
to X-rays][0] and strong DC electric fields — they prevent it from
setting.  (Even more astonishingly, he claims polarized laser light
affects its setting.)

What if this is true?

[Ring and Ping][a83] give more detail:

> Cements formulated near the stoichiometry of the 5-phase [i.e., 5MgO
> + 1MgCl₂] reaction, e.g. 0.8987 kg/L (7.5 lbs/gal) and 28.9±0.15%
> MgCl₂ brine, are the strongest.  Kinetic experiments observed that
> the 5-phase is formed quickly, but the kinetics are not complete for
> several days. The cement does not set by the 5-phase reaction when
> exposed to Cu Kα x-rays but gives a putty like form having
> MgCl₂*6H₂O crystals that do not set into a cement. These are the
> first observations of x-ray altered cementation reaction kinetics.

Does this mean you could use X-rays to 3-D print an object out of
Sorel cement?
