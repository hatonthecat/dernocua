Fan noise is painfully irritating in part because it’s constant and
relatively spectrally pure — it’s not a sinusoid, but it’s almost all
harmonics of a particular frequency, so the sonic energy is
concentrated with high Q in a small fraction of all possible
frequencies.

In experimenting with bytebeat I’ve found that a bit of envelope
modulation at 0.5–2 Hz can go a long way toward reducing the pain
level of tones.  Could you do that with a fan?  For example, closing
the fan with a baffle for 500 ms every 2 seconds would nearly silence
it.
