Dernocua is my notebook from 02021.  It’s the sequel to [Dercuano] and
[Derctuo].  It contains about 410000 words, about 1100 pages, in 267
notes on various different topics: programming, machining,
electronics, digital fabrication, math, physics, economics, history,
and so on.  These are mostly notes I made while I was figuring things
out, so they have a lot of errors in them because of things I
understood incorrectly, and many of them are incomplete.

Dernocua’s canonical form is [a downloadable tarball of HTML
files][tarball].  For computers that can’t handle tarballs of HTML,
I’ve also hacked together [an inferior PDF rendering of it][pdf],
formatted for comfortable reading on small screens like those on hand
computers.  (In particular, a lot of the Unicode-art stuff is screwed
up in the PDF, and so are tables.)  Errata will be published at [the
GitLab repository][gitlab].
